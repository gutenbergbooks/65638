  <h2 class='c006'>PREFACE</h2>
</div>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>If</span> the reader should inquire what special
claims the present author can put forward
to treat so complex and indeed novel a
subject, the first reply is, of course, that he
has thought a long time and with much
care about it, and this, for a theorist, is
sufficient vindication. But it may fairly
be added that a writer on the principles
of conversation ought to live in a country
where the practice of it is confessedly on
a high level, and where the average man
is able to talk well. This is an additional
justification. Lastly, though examples
cannot teach the art, it is to be expected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>that the writer should not live altogether
in his study, but should go out and hear
as many good conversations as possible,
in order to bring his theories to the
practical test. These three conditions
having been honestly fulfilled, the failure
of the book will rather be due to want of
ability than to want of honest preparation
in the author.</p>
<p class='c008'>The generality of the treatment may
perhaps mislead the reader to think that
there is nothing but speculation attempted.
This is not so, each single case of general
description being drawn from instances
under the author’s own observation, so
that not a few will be recognised by those
who have moved in the same society.
But, if justly drawn, they ought to be
found in every society.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_ix'>ix</span>In seeking for advice among those
whose conversation has supplied the best
materials for his theory, the author has
been fortunate enough to obtain the assistance
of the <span class='sc'>Marchioness of Londonderry</span>
and <span class='sc'>Lady Audrey Buller</span>, who
have made suggestions and criticisms
which he here cordially acknowledges.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>
<p class='c007'><a id='s1'></a>§ 1. <span class='sc'>There</span> can be no doubt that of all
the accomplishments prized in modern
society that of being agreeable in conversation
is the very first. It may be
called the social result of Western
civilisation, beginning with the Greeks.
Whatever contempt the North American
Indian or the Mohammedan Tartar may
feel for talking as mere chatter, it is
agreed among us that people must
meet frequently, both men and women, and
that not only is it agreeable to talk, but
that it is a matter of common courtesy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>to say something, even when there is
hardly anything to say. Every civilised
man and woman feels, or ought to feel,
this duty; it is the universal accomplishment
which all must practise, and as
those who fail signally to attain it are
punished by the dislike or neglect of
society, so those who succeed beyond the
average receive a just reward, not only in
the constant pleasure they reap from it, but
in the esteem which they gain from their
fellows. Many men and many women
owe the whole of a great success in life
to this and nothing else. An agreeable
young woman will always carry away the
palm in the long run from the most brilliant
player or singer who has nothing to
say. And though men are supposed
to succeed in life by dead knowledge, or
by acquaintance with business, it is often
by their social qualities, by their agreeable
way of putting things, and not by their
more ponderous merits that they prevail.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>In the high profession of diplomacy, both
home and foreign, this is pre-eminently the
case.</p>
<p class='c008'>But quite apart from all these serious
profits, and better than them all, is the
daily pleasure derived from good conversation
by those who can attain to it themselves
or enjoy it in others. It is a perpetual
intellectual feast, it is an ever-ready
recreation, a deep and lasting comfort,
costing no outlay but that of time,
requiring no appointments but a small
company, limited neither to any age nor
any sex, the delight of prosperity, the
solace of adversity, the eternal and essential
expression of that social instinct which
is one of the strongest and best features
in human nature.</p>

<p class='c008'><a id='s2'></a>§ 2. If such be the universality and the
necessity of conversation in modern society,
it seems an obvious inquiry whether it can
be taught or acquired by any fixed method;
or rather, as everybody has to practise it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>in some way, not as a mere ornament, but
as a necessity of life, it may be asked: Is
there any method by which we can improve
our conversation? Is there any
theory of it which we can apply in our
own case and that of others? If not, are
there at least some practical rules which
we ought to know, and which we should
follow in endeavouring to perform this
essential part of our social duties?</p>

<p class='c008'>To assert that there is some such systematic
analysis of conversation possible
is to assert that it is an <i>Art</i>—a practical
science like the art of reasoning called
Logic, or the art of eloquence called
Rhetoric. Now this runs counter to one
of the strongest convictions of all intelligent
men and women, that if anything
in the world ought to be spontaneous
it is conversation. How can
a thing be defined by rules which consists
in following the chances of the moment,
drifting with the temper of the company,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>suiting the discourse to whatever subject
may turn up? The instant any one is
felt to be talking by rules all the charm of
his society vanishes, and he becomes the
worst of social culprits—a bore. For it is
the natural easy flow of talk which is
indeed the perfection of what we seek.
Didactic teaching, humorous anecdotes,
clever argument—these may take their
part in social intercourse, but they are not
its perfection. To take up what others
say in easy comment, to give in return
something which will please, to stimulate
the silent and the morose out of their
vapours and surprise them into good humour,
to lead while one seems to
follow—this is the real aim of good conversation.
How can such a Protean impalpable
acquirement be in any way an
art depending on rules? Does it not
altogether depend on natural gifts, on a
ready power of expression, on a sanguine
temperament, on a quick power of sympathy,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>on a placid temper? Is there not a
risk, nay a certainty, that in dissecting it
we shall slay its life and destroy its
beauty?</p>

<p class='c008'><a id='s3'></a>§ 3. However natural and reasonable
this objection, it is based on the mistake
that art is opposed to nature, that natural
means <i>merely</i> what is spontaneous and unprepared,
and artistic what is <i>manifestly</i>
studied and artificial. This is one of the
commonest and most widely-spread popular
errors. If such were the real meaning
of <i>natural</i>, it might be argued that
nothing was natural in man above the
condition of the lowest savage—the <i>Naturmensch</i>,
as the Germans call him. And if
such were the meaning of <i>artistic</i> we must
exclude from art the highest of all its
functions—that of reproducing, or perhaps
even of producing, nature in its most
precious and perfect phases. It is a curious
reflection that conventionality and awkwardness
seem the most universal inheritance,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>and so far thoroughly natural to
men, that they require either conscious art
or the unconsciousness attending some
violent emotion to keep them clear of it.
The savage has it strongly marked in him;
the most enlightened societies are encumbered
with it. Ask any child of five or six
years old, anywhere over Europe, to draw
you the figure of a man, and it will always
produce very much the same kind of thing.
You might, therefore, assert that this was
the <i>natural</i> way for a child to draw a man,
and yet how remote from nature it is. If
one or two out of a thousand made a fair
attempt and avoided the conventional
treatment, you would attribute this either
to special genius or special training—and
why? because the child had really approached
nature.</p>

<p class='c008'><a id='s4'></a>§ 4. Let us leave generalities and consider
practical sciences, which have a closer
analogy to the subject under discussion.
The science of Logic or analysis of reasoning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>professes to show us how men ought to
reason, and to discover the precise nature
of their mistakes when they reason falsely.
Yet the best reasoner is not the man who
parades his logic and thrusts syllogisms
upon his opponents, but he who states his
arguments as if they came spontaneously
and followed one another by natural suggestion.
In fact, the man who parades his
logic is one of those poor and narrow
thinkers whose over-attention to form mars
his comprehension of the matter, and so
leads him astray. The logically formal
reasoner is generally a bad persuader. And
yet logic is not to be blamed for this man’s
stupidity. The fact that he goes wrong
on every practical question is not due to
logic, but to the man’s narrowness of
vision or his vanity in parading an art that
does not admit of parade in its proper
use.</p>

<p class='c008'>The case is still clearer with Rhetoric,
or the science of speaking persuasively in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>public. Here we have a science so akin
to that of which we are in search, that
the points of importance may serve as
direct clues to discover what we want.
The most obvious points about rhetoric
as a practical science are these: it pre-supposes
some natural gifts in the pupil,
and though we have notable instances of
men overcoming great congenital obstacles
by study, the fact of this very
conquest shows that a fund of power or
of passion lay concealed beneath these
hindrances. No stupid or idle person, no
person without any flow of ideas ever
was, or could be made, an effective
speaker by studying rhetoric.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the other hand, every speaker, bad
or good, is greatly improved by a study
of this science, and by reflecting on the
suggestions it gives him. There is no
orator, however naturally ready and fluent,
who will not profit immensely by such a
study. Nay, even those who have formed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>themselves as speakers by long practice,
have generally constructed for themselves
some such science or body of rules which
they consciously obey, and which gives
them most of their efficiency and power;
so that even if they have succeeded without
studying the science of rhetoric, they
are not therefore devoid of rhetorical study.</p>

<p class='c008'>But it is of the last importance, as was
already observed in the case of logic, that
a man’s theory of speaking should not be
paraded to his hearers. The moment
they are made aware that he has drawn
up premeditated engines of persuasion, as
it were, in position, they fortify themselves
against them, and what the orator gains
in display, he loses in power. For here,
as in all art, the real perfection is to
reproduce nature—not nature in its halting,
and stammering, and repetition, but
nature in its most perfect and purified
form. Here, too, the untutored speaker is
always conventional and consciously awkward;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>it is the trained orator who is easy
and graceful; he is in fact at home not
only with his audience, but, if I may say
so, with himself.</p>

<p class='c008'>In public speaking, however, studied
effects and evident preparation, though not
agreeable, though not showing the highest
art, are still excusable, owing to the acknowledged
difficulties with which that art
is beset. It is not so with conversation.
Here, if anywhere, the first thing to be
aimed at is to appear perfectly natural.
Hence the fact that no “theory of conversation”
has yet been attempted.
But hence also the fact that such an
analysis is very much needed, and that
conversation generally is at a far lower
level than it might be. The many analogies
already pointed out, and many others
which will suggest themselves to any
intelligent reader, indicate that the line to
be followed in this discussion must be
determined by the sister art of rhetoric, if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>indeed conversation can be called a sister
art, and not a mere pendant to the art of
rhetoric. In general, good public speakers
are also agreeable in conversation; the
art of persuading people from a platform
is nearly akin to that of pleasing them in
social discourse, though there are of course
some men only fit for the greater and more
serious mission, and some who are perfect
enough in the lesser yet who cannot
rise to the importance of the greater
task.<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c021'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c012'><span class='label'><a href='#r1'>1</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>So it was said of Phæax, the contemporary of Alcibiades
and Cleon, λαλεῑν ἄριστος, ἀδυνατὠτατος λἐγειν—a
capital talker, but the worst of speakers.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c008'><a id='s5'></a>§ 5. The analogy, therefore, being established,
we may feel tolerably certain of the
following results, which should be stated
at the outset in order to allay any vain or
excessive expectations: (1) no teaching of
the art of conversation by specimens is
possible. Even in rhetoric this is very
difficult, and yet rhetoric is busied about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>weighty topics which must often recur in
the same form. But in the case of conversation,
except to point out some notable
examples in great authors, any teaching
by special cases is quite illusory. It
would at once tempt the learner to force
the train of the discourse into the vein he
had practised, and to force conversation
is in other words to spoil it. (2) As in
logic and in rhetoric, we may be certain
that all the general rules, when stated,
will be perfectly obvious. The notion of
any of these sciences being mysteries,
whereby a secret or magic power is to
be acquired, is only fit for the dark ages.
The broad foundations of logic are nothing
but truisms; the rules of rhetoric are
founded on these truisms, combined with
psychological observations neither subtle
nor deep. So we may be certain that
the laws of good conversation, being such
as can be practised by all, are no witchery,
but something simple and commonplace,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>perhaps neglected on account of their
very plainness. (3) But simple as these
rules may be, it requires a certain special
faculty to apply them—a faculty which
may be called common sense, or judgment,
or genius—a something which some
men and women have not at all and can
never acquire, but which the great majority
have in some degree, and this determines
their success more than all the rules in
the world. So it is with eloquence of the
higher kind. What are called natural
gifts start one man far ahead of another.
And yet these external qualities may be
outrun by a larger mental gift, which overcomes
weakness of voice, and poverty of
frame, and makes a man whose presence
is mean, and whose speech at first contemptible,
fascinate great audiences with
his genius. We will not define what this
peculiar quality is in the case of conversation,
but it is necessary to feel its presence
from the very outset.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'><span class='sc'>Subjective Side—Physical Conditions</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c022'><a id='s6'></a>§ 6. There are no physical conditions
absolutely necessary for becoming a good
talker. I have known a man with a painful
impediment in his speech far more
agreeable than all the fluent people in the
room. But when a man comes to consider
by what conditions conversation can be
improved, and turns first of all to his own
side, to see what he can do for himself in
that direction, he will find that certain
natural gifts which he may possess, or the
absence of which he may regret, are of no
small importance in making him more
agreeable to those whom he meets in
society. It seems desirable to mention
these at the outset for completeness’ sake,
and also that educators may lay their
foundations in children for after use in the
world.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>The old Greeks set it down as an axiom
that a loud or harsh voice betokened bad
breeding, and any one who hears the lower
classes discussing any topic at the corners
of the streets, may notice not merely their
coarseness and rudeness in expression, but
also the loudness and harshness of their
voices, in support of this observation. The
habit of wrangling with people who will
not listen without interruption, and who
try to shout down their company, nay even
the habit of losing one’s temper, engenders
a noisy and harsh way of speaking, which
naturally causes a prejudice against the
talker in good society. Even the dogmatic
or over-confident temper which
asserts opinions loudly, and looks round to
command approval or challenge contradiction,
chills good conversation by setting
people against the speaker, whom they
presume to be a social bully and wanting
in sympathy.</p>

<p class='c008'>Contrariwise, nothing attracts more at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>first hearing than a soft and sweet tone of
voice. It generally suggests a deeper well
of feeling than the speaker possesses, and
certainly prejudices people as much in his
favour as a grating or loud utterance repels
them. It is to be classed with personal
beauty, which disposes every one to favour
the speaker, and listen to him or her with
sympathy and attention. This sweetness
in the tone of the voice is chiefly a natural
gift, but it may also be improved, if not
acquired, by constant and careful training
in early years. It can certainly be
marred by constant straining and shouting.
It should therefore be carefully
cultivated or protected in youth as a
valuable vantage-ground in social intercourse.</p>

<p class='c008'>Similarly the presence of a strong local
accent, though there are cases where it
gives raciness to wit and pungency to satire,
is usually a hindrance in conversation,
especially at its outset, and among strangers.<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c021'><sup>[2]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>It marks a man as provincial, and
hence is akin to vulgarity and narrowness
of mind. It suggests too that the
speaker has not moved much about the
world, or even in the best society of his
native country, in which such provincialism
is carefully avoided, and set down as an
index of mind and manners below the
highest level. Hence all careful educators
endeavour to eradicate peculiarities of
accent or pronunciation in children, and
justly, though we have all met great talkers
whose Scotch burr or Irish brogue seemed
an essential feature of their charm. If
this be so, no education can eradicate it.
In lesser people to be provincial is distinctly
an obstacle in the way, even though
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>a great mind may turn it into a stepping-stone.</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f2'>
<p class='c012'><span class='label'><a href='#r2'>2</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It has been suggested to me that a slight impediment
or stammer often gives peculiar zest to conversation. But
this is hardly the case at first hearing; it is only appreciated
when we have discovered that what the speaker is
hesitating to utter is worth waiting for. It then produces
the same kind of surprise that irony does, which is often
deliberate mental stammering.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c008'><a id='s7'></a>§ 7. There is yet another almost physical
disability or damage to conversation,
which is akin to provincialism, and which
consists in disagreeable tricks in conversation,
such as the constant and meaningless
repetition of catchwords and phrases, such
as the unmeaning oaths of our grandfathers,
such as inarticulate sounds of assent, such
as contortions of the face, which so annoy
the hearer by their very want of meaning
and triviality as to excite quite a disproportionate
dislike to the speaker, and
to require great and sterling qualities to
counterbalance it. However apt a man’s
internal furniture may be for conversation,
he may make it useless by being externally
disagreeable, and how often when
we praise a friend as a good talker do we
hear the reply: I should like him well
enough if he did not worry me with his
<i>don’t you know</i>, or his <i>what</i>, or his <i>exactly so</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>or something else so childishly small, that
we shudder to think how easily a man may
forfeit his position or popularity among
civilised men in their daily intercourse. But
modern society, which ought to be of all
things in human life the most easy and
unconstrained, is growing every day more
tyrannical and only to be kept in good
humour by careful attention to its unwritten
behests, unless indeed we have the
power to bend it to our will, and force it
to follow our lead instead of driving us
along like slaves.</p>

<p class='c008'>No more need be said concerning these
physical conditions, which are rather
negative conditions, or favourable starting
points, than real aids for our purpose. The
handsomest man or woman, even with the
sweetest tones of human voice, will soon
be found out, if dull or unsympathetic,
and then these advantages all go for
nothing.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>
  <h2 class='c006'><span class='sc'>Mental Conditions—Special Knowledge</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c022'><a id='s8'></a>§ 8. Far more important than the
physical gifts of nature, which can only
be slightly improved, though they can be
completely marred by habit, are the mental
conditions of conversation. Among these
the most obvious is, of course, Knowledge.
An ignorant man is seldom agreeable in
conversation, except as a butt; a man
full of knowledge is certain to be agreeable
if he will conform to the other conditions
of the game. The word <i>knowledge</i>
is, however, so vague, that we must be at
pains to define more particularly its
divisions, and consider what kind of
knowledge is most conducive to good
conversation.</p>

<p class='c008'>Of course the first question suggested
to the reader is whether general or special
knowledge in the speaker is to be preferred.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>There are arguments in favour of each.
Let us take the specialist first. There is
undoubtedly a great satisfaction in talking
to a man who is master of any special subject,
even if it be remote from ordinary life.
Intelligent questions will draw from the
astronomer, from the chemist, possibly
from the pure mathematician, curious facts
and interesting views on the progress of
discovery, which will pleasantly beguile
the time even in a light-minded and
frivolous company. This opens a field for
conversation which is inaccessible if there
be no one present to explain or to speak
with authority, and so no invitation is more
frequent or more welcome than to come
and meet a man celebrated in his own
line and of wide reputation. The very
fact of meeting such a man disposes the
company to be sympathetic, and to draw
from him the secrets of his knowledge.</p>

<p class='c008'>This kind of vantage-ground may be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>occupied by a man of no original capacity
or deep learning, if accident has made him
intimate with some exciting or absorbing
subject of the day. The man who has
just escaped a shipwreck, or fought in a
famous battle, or survived some catastrophe,
has for the moment the advantage
of being endowed with special knowledge,
which everybody wants to talk about, and
to learn particulars from the actual eye-witness.
Akin to this is the advantage of
having seen and conversed with the greatest
men of the day—a feature which lends
the principal charm to those volumes of
autobiography or of <i>recollections</i>, which
approach nearer than any other kind
of book to the conditions of a conversation.</p>

<p class='c008'><a id='s9'></a>§ 9. Of course the danger with either of
these specialists, the specialist of a day or
the specialist of years, is that he will not
leave his subject when it has been sufficiently
discussed, as he will probably gauge
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>the interest of others by his own preoccupation,
and so may become not a blessing
but a bore to his company. Though
this is frequently the case, those who have
gathered company about them for conversation,
and have long experience of what is
most likely to succeed, will agree with me
that to have a specialist present is always
valuable. If other topics flag an appeal to
this abundant source will always introduce
a new current of talk, and often of the
most agreeable kind.</p>

<p class='c008'>Neither of these mental conditions,
which are distinctly valuable in society,
include the case of specialists on topics
which are of no universal or no permanent
interest. Thus there are in English
society men devoted to one particular
sport or one narrow pursuit, upon which
they can talk with authority indeed, and
with interest, but only to those who have
received the same training. A party of
fox-hunters, or racing-men, or college
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>dons, or stockbrokers, who rehearse again
in the evening what they have been doing
all day, may indeed amuse themselves
with talk, but in no sense is it good conversation.
One specialist, as I have said,
may be of the greatest use in conversation.
A set of specialists when they get together
are either unintelligible to the average
mind or exceedingly tedious.</p>

<p class='c008'>The same remarks apply to specialists,
men or women, who can only discuss
topics interesting to one sex. I will not
go so far as to say that no conversation
can be really good which does not include
speakers of both sexes; the divergence in
the education and the life of our boys
and of our girls is still too wide to make
such a limitation reasonable. But it is
surely a bad sign of any society to find
men’s parties considered more agreeable
than those of both sexes, for it is a sign
either of licence in men’s talk or of narrowness
in women’s education. There are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>cases of both within most people’s
experience. The latter is notably the
case in some parts of Ireland, and arises
from the want of <i>political</i> education in
Irish women of any but the highest
classes. And so it is in many other
countries. But this is verging upon the
educational conclusions which we must
postpone to another occasion.</p>
<div class='pbb'>
 <hr class='pb c005' />
</div>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'><span class='sc'>General Knowledge</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c022'><a id='s10'></a>§ 10. We come now to the broader condition
of General Knowledge. This, in the
minds of many, sums up in itself all the
conditions of good conversation, and yet
it is so partial a truth as to be practically
misleading. A great mistake lies at the
root of such an opinion, which assumes
that the first object of conversation is
not to please but to instruct. I could produce
one hundred Irish peasants more
agreeable than many a highly-informed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>Englishman, and yet these peasants might
in many cases be unable to read or
write. Of course to instruct or to be
instructed is often very pleasant, and so
far knowledge, general or special, is a very
useful help to conversation, but it is as
talk, not as a lesson, that we must here
regard it.</p>

<p class='c008'>The advantage of general above special
knowledge for our purpose is that it can
be applied in a greater number of cases,
and used to interest a greater number of
people. The man of general knowledge
can suit himself to various company, and,
if he is not able to speak with the authority
of the specialist, can help and stimulate
in many cases where the latter is likely to
be silent. If therefore we exclude the
object of gaining information, which many
people estimate above its importance in
our present subject, we must decide that
general information is the better condition
to promote agreeable social intercourse.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>It may be attained in two directions;
either knowledge of books or knowledge
of men. The former is within the reach of
most men, even though it requires a peculiar
memory to make it applicable with
ease and readiness. We may even say
with truth that no man can attain to general
knowledge nowadays without reading
many books. The danger of a desultory
habit, very likely to arise from skimming
the mass of ephemeral literature now gushing
from the press, is that the facts acquired
will not be ordered, and will come out as
untidy scraps, not as the details of a
proper system of study. The books which
a man reads may either be the great
masters, which are perhaps rather useful
for cultivating his deeper self than for
ordinary converse, or the newest authors,
whose merits are still upon trial, and who
therefore afford an excellent field for discussion
and criticism. In either case
there is hardly a distinction to be drawn
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>between the specialist and the generalist,
for all people are supposed to study
literature, and a good knowledge of either
familiar or fashionable books can hardly
fail to tell in any gathering of cultivated
men and women.</p>

<p class='c008'><a id='s11'></a>§ 11. There is, however, another kind
of general knowledge which is not so easy
to acquire, for it requires long experience,
a certain position in society, and means
for foreign travel. I mean the general
knowledge of remarkable men, concerning
whom the speaker can tell his recollections.
There is often a man of no great learning
or ability whose official position, tact, or
private means have brought him into contact
with the great minds about whom
every detail is interesting. Such a man’s
general knowledge should always make
him an agreeable member of society.
Akin to this man is the experienced traveller
who has wandered through many lands
and seen the cities and the ways of men.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>The peculiar advantage of this kind of
general knowledge for conversation is that
its very acquisition comes in the practice of
society, and that all those defects of narrowness,
awkwardness, and self-consciousness
which often mar the man of books,
are rubbed off, as the phrase is, by constant
contact with various men. The man
of books, on the contrary, has to acquire
his store in the silence of his study, and
so by a process which rather untrains
him for talking, so that even though his
knowledge when acquired may be of more
solid and permanent value, his way of
producing it may put him at a disadvantage.</p>

<p class='c008'>Let me add before leaving this head
that the enormous increase of the means
for acquiring knowledge, and the application
of great inventions to save time in so
doing, are by no means accompanied by
corresponding strides in the art of conversation.
All the knowledge of the day
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>professes to be curtailed and collected into
newspapers, periodicals, and handbooks,
just as all the travelling of the day is
done by rail and steam, with the aid of
guide-books, which save the traveller all
the trouble and all the education of thinking.
The tourist who formerly went
through Italy with his <i>vetturino</i>, and saw
every village and road deliberately, talking
with the people and observing national life,
is now whirled through tunnels and by
night from one capital to another, where
he sees what Cook or Murray choose him
to see, just as the man who trusts the newspapers
for his knowledge gets scraps, perversions,
even lies, served up for him by
way of universal information. It is easy to
see that this kind of training, as it interferes
with both liberty and leisure of
thought, and induces men to spend far
too much time in gathering facts, is in
no way conducive to the improvement of
conversation.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>
  <h2 class='c006'><span class='sc'>Intellectual Quickness</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c022'><a id='s12'></a>§ 12. What has hitherto been said
about knowledge in a man of conversation
has left out of all account the way
of producing it, and merely considered
the mental store from which conversation
may be supplied. But almost as important
as these materials, is the faculty
of producing them without effort. This
quality may be called intellectual <i>quickness</i>,
as distinguished from solidity; and
of all the conditions we have yet discussed,
this seems most due to nature, and
unattainable by education. It is indeed
sometimes a characteristic of nations.
The Irishman or the Frenchman will
show this quality with an average excellence
far above that attained in England
or Germany. It may of course be allied
with, or even due to, some such moral
quality as sympathy, of which we shall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>speak presently. But quite apart from
it, a selfish man, who has no sympathy
for his company, may, by the quickness of
his intellect, show brilliantly in conversation,
while his more solid and worthy
fellow is considered a bore. As I have
just said, this is generally a gift of nature.
Some men and some nations are born
with quick wits. But even so it is a
great mistake to think that it may not
be vastly improved by intercourse with
people who have the faculty already well
developed. Moreover it is a very dangerous
advantage, and if not deepened by
solid acquirements, or chastened by moral
restraints, may make a man rather the
scourge than the delight of his company.</p>

<p class='c008'>For this is the mental quality which is
the foundation of wit, and a joker who
merely consults his own amusement, or the
amusement of some of his hearers at the
expense of others, is not a good converser.
The tendency of a very quick intellect is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>also to impatience, and so it will interfere
with and cow more modest minds, which
might have contributed well to the feast of
talk had they been allowed to work without
hurry or pressure. So strong do we
often find this contrast that it is unadvisable,
in choosing a set of people for conversation,
to bring together very slow and
very quick intellects. While the former
are more dazzled and confused than
pleased, the latter feel the delay of listening
to long and deliberate sentences intolerable;
and so a company in which all the
members are socially excellent may fail to
be pleasant on account of the mental
contrasts of its members.</p>

<p class='c008'>Let me illustrate it by an extreme case.
Who would think of introducing a young
brilliant flashing sceptic into a society of
grave and sober orthodoxy? If the conversation
did not soon degenerate into acrid
controversy—the very lees of social intercourse—it
would result in contemptuous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>silence on one side or other, probably with
the contempt so transparent as to challenge
harsh over-statement from the talker
by way of challenge or reply to unspoken
censure. Could anything be more ruinous
to the object we have in view? It may
be urged on the other hand that if too many
quick intellects are brought together—not
a very easy thing, by the way, to accomplish—the
pressure will become too great
and the conversation move so fast that the
strain may become a weariness. I think
that any danger in this direction is rather
due to the moral defects of the talkers
than their intellectual brightness, and so
I shall discuss this point under another
head.</p>

<p class='c008'>But if the quality under consideration
is valuable at all times, it is so peculiarly
when a number of strangers meet
together, or when it is the lot of men and
women to be obliged to talk together in
dialogue, upon a stray or sudden occasion.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>Then it is, when for example you
go down to dinner with a strange man or
woman whose name you have not caught,
that quickness of intellect becomes the
prime agent in starting a pleasant conversation.
There are, indeed, even here
many easy rules which may help to get
over the initial difficulty, without those
initial chords about the weather whereby
so many people, otherwise really intelligent,
hide themselves at the outset under
the prelude of commonplace. But here
as elsewhere art can only imitate better
nature.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is further to be added that as general
knowledge, and special also, are principally
to be expected from men, so quickness
of mind, which is often impaired by
deeper study, is the proper attribute of
women, and ought to be the distinctive
quality of their conversation. This is
supposed to be so in French society; I
cannot say that it has come under my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>observation as a general law, the many
instances which I have met being always
noted and quoted as brilliant and as exceptional,
so implying that it was not the rule.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'><span class='sc'>Moral Conditions—Modesty</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c022'><a id='s13'></a>§ 13. We may now pass from the intellectual
conditions of conversation to
what I may call, for simplicity’s sake, the
moral conditions. It is, of course, certain
that these so-called moral qualities are
frequently congenital or constitutional, and
that, therefore, the owner of them deserves
no credit for possessing them. But as
they are qualities enjoined upon us by
moralists, and are in any case analogous
to moral virtues, we may in this book,
which does not affect precise philosophy,
class them as moral. For example, the
instinct of sociality, which is really the
same as the gregarious instinct in birds
and animals, is not the same as the love
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>of our neighbour enjoined by the Gospel,
but is closely connected with it, for to be
social without being civil is not possible,
and civility is at least the imitation of
friendship, if it be not friendship or benevolence
in outward acts of social intercourse.
This, too, appears to be the reason
why a particular class of social instincts
is so agreeable to men, and so honoured
in society—their close relationship to moral
virtues.</p>

<p class='c008'>Let me take up the first and most
obvious—Modesty.<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c021'><sup>[3]</sup></a> It is quite certain
that modesty and its opposite are congenital
to various people. Those who
have to do with the education of children
can see it within the limits of a family, not
to say a school. Some boys and girls are
naturally retiring, and think little of their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>powers; others are the reverse. But here
too, as we all know, early education may
make great changes. A child not originally
remarkable in either way may be
unduly brought forward and applauded,
or again unduly repressed and cowed,
so that the constant habit of early years
may actually modify the original character
in either of two opposite directions. But
this is only possible when the original
nature is not strongly declared; if it
be so, I hold education to be almost
helpless.</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f3'>
<p class='c012'><span class='label'><a href='#r3'>3</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I include here under the word all its various gradations
from mere bashfulness to that moral self-restraint
which makes us fear to assert ourselves, as implying an
over-estimate of our powers.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c008'>When the child is growing to maturity
it is likely to be strongly affected by
watching the defects of others, or hearing
the frequent censure of them. Thus I see
that the children of people with too much
manner are apt to have no manner at all
(as the phrase is), and the children of
incessant talkers are so bored with this
social vice that they never think of practising
talk during the absence of their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>parents. Let us apply these remarks to
modesty.</p>

<p class='c008'><a id='s14'></a>§ 14. There is no quality in man, still
more in woman, which is more attractive
and which commands more respect. Every
intelligent and sympathetic person makes
allowance for it, and strives to lessen the
necessary pains which it inflicts upon the
possessor of it in society. It is akin to
simplicity and honesty, and opposed to
that artificiality which is the outward and
visible sign of some kind of dishonesty.
It lends a charm to youth and inexperience,
so that people who are wearied with
the labours of talking to worn and world-stained
equals feel, as it were, the breath
of gorse and heather after the odours
of city air when they come in contact
with genuine modesty. It is a quality
sometimes allied with that heaven-born
genius which attains great results without
apparent effort, and, therefore, is not infected
with the pride of having gained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>conscious and hard-fought successes. It
is, lastly, the outcome of great and solid
labour, which teaches the specialist how
much he fails to know, and the general
student how small a fragment of human
knowledge he has compassed. Here it is
no natural quality, but an acquired virtue;
yet it excites the same kind of feeling in
society.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is, therefore, no quality more
highly valuable in society and more certain,
<i>within limits</i>, to conduce to agreeable
conversation. Perhaps the clearest
reservation, and one which will cover
almost all the various cases, is this:
<i>modesty without simplicity</i>, though it may
still be a moral virtue, is always a social
vice; and therefore highly detrimental to
good conversation; for as soon as modesty
becomes conscious, it assumes one of two
forms—the parade of apology or the
cloak of reserve.</p>

<p class='c008'>I need hardly insist that the man or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>woman who displays modesty by constantly
apologising for native ignorance
or stupidity injures conversation, and can
only amuse a company by becoming
ridiculous. What we want to learn from
each member is his free opinion on
the subject in hand, not his own estimate
of the value of that opinion.
How evidently this is a social vice will
appear from the fact that an assumption
of this kind of modesty is one of the
commonest and most diverting forms of
humour—I mean the irony which has
been the helper of conversation ever since
the days of Socrates, as we find him in
Plato’s <i>Dialogues</i>.</p>
<div class='pbb'>
 <hr class='pb c005' />
</div>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'><span class='sc'>Moral Conditions—Simplicity</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c022'><a id='s15'></a>§ 15. We cannot analyse the second
form of conscious modesty, Reserve, till we
have said a few words on the virtue akin
to modesty which reserve particularly violates,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>I mean of the quality of Simplicity.
It is a great mistake to say that simplicity
as such is always a virtue. There
is for example the <i>enfant terrible</i> who
upsets everybody and causes shocking
shame and confusion by the indiscreet
directness of his inquiries. The very same
kind of mistake is made by grown people
who are ignorant of the ways of society,
such as country girls, or girls of an inferior
rank, who are married into a cultivated
society, and who are allowed such liberties,
either for their beauty’s sake, or for
novelty’s sake, that they announce whatever
comes into their head, and disturb
conversation by their irrelevancy and
shallowness, if not by suggesting subjects
undesirable in general society.
There is also the blunt man, whose simplicity
takes the form of rudeness, who
thinks it more important that he should
speak out the plain truth, than that he
should spare the feelings of others. This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>is again a vice parading under the form
of a virtue—perhaps here of truthfulness
rather than simplicity, but the two are
so akin that at this point we need not
draw distinctions. The conversational
side of truthfulness is after all little more
than directness and simplicity of utterance.</p>

<p class='c008'>So far then I have put the defects of
simplicity first, because they are more
likely to be overlooked than its advantages.
When, therefore, these important limitations
are made, and they affect a great
number of cases, we must admit that there
is the greatest charm in simplicity, in
the temper which without assumption of
ignorance, or parade of inexperience, opens
a candid eye of inquiry upon the company,
receives with readiness new information,
and is ready to tell without conceits or
ornaments the actual impressions in the
speaker’s mind.</p>

<p class='c008'>It may be found not only along with
genius, which is often of this character, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>along with great experience and acuteness;
we hear for example, that it is the leading
characteristic of Prince Bismarck’s
conversation. I remember it likewise with
delight in the conversation of the late
Isaac Butt, an Irish genius of the highest
order, and a talker second to none, whose
life was stormy, and whose character
not by any means such as would naturally
imply this quality of simplicity. On
the other hand, it is quite extravagant to
postulate it as a necessary sign of genius,
and to say that those who are wanting in
it are certainly wanting either in ability or
honesty. There are great minds naturally
wanting in simplicity, just as there are
great minds wanting in modesty or in
truthfulness—such as J. J. Rousseau and
the great Napoleon in the latter two, and
one great English writer of our day in the
former, whom I need not name. Human
nature will not be tied down in any such
fetters.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>But when all has been said that can be
said on either side, it will remain certain
that the man who appears simple, and who
therefore affects his company with the
impression that they are in direct contact
with his mind, has a distinct advantage
over those who either from conceits of
style, or over-delicacy of sentiment, or
education in an artificial atmosphere,
appear with their minds, as it were,
dressed or tattooed, and not in the
purity of nature.</p>

<p class='c008'>I need hardly add that it is necessary
to sever simplicity from modesty as social
qualities, since the one may even contradict
the other, though they are so often in
harmony. The blunt man above mentioned,
who speaks out his mind with over-simplicity,
may be very devoid of modesty,
and conversely there are certain phases of
modesty, such as <i>prudery</i>, which make the
speaker avoid simplicity, and cover his
meaning by various subterfuges. It is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>when the two qualities work together,
and appear habitual to the speaker, that
they produce their admirable effect. If
he is narrating, for example, a tragic
history, or story of adventure in which
he has taken part, while his modesty will
prevent him from magnifying his own
share in the matter, and so trying to the
utmost the faith of his hearers, his
simplicity will prevent him from unduly
concealing his action, and will ensure
that he tells the whole truth, so far
as he knows it. If again he be asked
his opinion on a question which he has
studied, and upon which he ought to be
an authority, his modesty may prevent
him from giving the company the benefit
of his knowledge, unless his simplicity
makes him attend directly to the matter
in hand, and not to the position of referee
in which he suddenly comes to be
placed.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'><span class='sc'>Moral Conditions—Shyness Reserve</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c022'><a id='s16'></a>§ 16. We have kept till now the main
violation of simplicity, and greatest of
modern hindrances to conversation, which
we have already mentioned in connection
with modesty.</p>

<p class='c008'>What distinction are we to make between
Shyness and reserve, two qualities
whose effects are generally similar, and
each of which is a great hindrance to good
conversation? We may start from the
distinctions in ordinary use. No man or
woman will openly claim to be reserved,
but many will plead that they are shy. The
reason of this is that shyness is assumed
to be a physical or at least constitutional
thing, whereas reserve implies deliberate
choice to stand aloof, and repel any intimacy
of conversation as unwarranted either
by the circumstances or by the relative
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>position of the speakers. Thus though
reserve <i>may</i> arise from modesty, it is
generally a form of pride, which for that
reason no one will attribute to himself.<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c021'><sup>[4]</sup></a>
On the other hand shyness is either
assumed to be a form, or an excess,
of modesty, which is a virtue, or it is
assumed to be congenital, and therefore
a defect to be excused rather than a fault
to be censured. So shy people as a rule
rather ’fancy themselves’; for though
they urge their peculiarity as an excuse
for social defects, there lies behind a secret
conviction that they at least have escaped
the vice of forwardness, or of that coarseness
of mental fibre which is implied in
forwardness. Accordingly, though there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>are many people who sincerely regret
their shyness upon particular occasions,
as for example, when they are compelled
to make a speech, or entertain some great
personage, yet you will not find any one
who would exchange it as a permanent
quality for perfect ease, or assurance, or
total absence of nervousness, or whatever
else the opposite of shyness may be called.
The more we reflect on this and other
similar symptoms in shyness, the more we
shall be convinced that here we have not
to deal with mere modesty, but with conscious
modesty, with modesty without
simplicity, and therefore really with a subtle
form of conceit.</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f4'>
<p class='c012'><span class='label'><a href='#r4'>4</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I am reminded that there are, especially in England,
people who desire to be thought reserved, and are
secretly proud of this reputation. It is, of course, part of
this pride not to declare it publicly. These exceptional
cases are, however, to be classed with those of people
who are secretly proud of other vices, and do not disturb
my theory.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c008'><a id='s17'></a>§ 17. There are of course cases of
children who are allowed to run away
whenever a stranger appears, as if nature
were a state of war, and man the natural
enemy of man. Such children will require
training to be cured of their own and their
parents’ stupidity, and must be taught that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>every stranger is not a bogy. But this is
mere domestication, such as we apply to
the lower animals. It is also possible,
though rare, that some people of refinement
and culture may have a physical
repugnance to meeting any but their intimates,
and that they may make honest
efforts in vain to overcome this stubborn
nervousness. The great majority of shy
people are not of this kind. Thus you
will see a girl extremely shy in ordinary
society, who blossoms out when she
receives attentions from some one who
may possibly marry her. Or else you
may find a youth, who jumps over a
hedge to avoid meeting a party of
his acquaintances on a country road,
anything but modest in lower society,
thus showing that it is a consciousness
of unfitness for good company and a
fear of being criticised which dominate
him. In almost all the cases which
occur there is therefore modesty without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>simplicity, a conscious and almost guilty
air; it is often nothing better than vanity
which fears the results of conversation,
which desires to be thought well of, and
which from mistrust of itself puts on the
garb of modesty.</p>

<p class='c008'>If shyness really arises from this cause,
it is a grave moral fault. But in any case
it is socially a crime. How can any conversation
be easy and natural, how can it
range from topic to topic, and bring out
the tempers and the characters of the
speakers, if any of them displays this vice
by dogged silence, by conscious blushing
when any personal topic arises, or by the
awkwardness which always accompanies
this noisome preoccupation with one’s self?
If then the capital conditions of pleasant
intercourse are modesty and simplicity,
this defect which always contradicts the
latter, and generally both of them, is to
be regarded as the most prevalent and
destructive anti-social vice. The only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>high quality which may be concealed, or
perhaps even displayed by shyness, is a
delicate sensitiveness, which shy people
generally postulate in themselves, but
which has far better and nobler ways of
affecting society than by impeding conversation.</p>

<p class='c008'><a id='s18'></a>§ 18. Reserve, which few venture to
claim for themselves, is a far higher and
better feeling, for it implies that the unwillingness
to enter upon conversation
arises from some deliberate judgment as
to the relative positions of the speaker
and his company—often a correct judgment,
saving us from the vice of familiarity,
which in an inferior is offensive, in
a superior uncomfortable, in either case
distinctly vulgar. We feel that reserve
can be laid aside in pleasant moments,
and among congenial people, and that there
is often force and dignity behind it. But
it is rarely a virtue which improves conversation,
and therefore need not occupy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>us here. It may indeed act as a check
on licence, and so by bringing the company
back from some aberration, start it
afresh on nobler and pleasanter topics.
This is so indirect a mode of action, and
may be so much more easily attained in
other ways, that I need only mention it
for completeness’ sake.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'><span class='sc'>Unselfishness</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c022'><a id='s19'></a>§ 19. Next to modesty and simplicity
I class the moral virtue of <i>unselfishness</i>.
It is very characteristic that we have no
other word for this noble quality than the
mere negation of its opposite—the most
prevalent vice in the world. Why can we
not describe it better? Because in particular
connections it has other names—loyalty,
devotion, self-sacrifice, which
occupy a part of the ground with more
especial attributes. We are not here concerned
with these heights of human nature,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>with the nobility of grand and pathetic
moments. What shows itself in these as
devotion and self-sacrifice bears in our
commonplace life a negative and non-descriptive
name, and is yet a very distinct
and valuable quality, distinct from
simplicity, distinct even from sympathy,
with which it is so often allied; it may
display itself in all kinds of men and
women who take part in a conversation.
It is not less important to the silent man
than to the talkative man, though the
latter case is the more obvious. The
good talker who monopolises conversation,
who insists on keeping other people waiting
that he may finish his story, who tells
anecdotes which are evidently unpleasant
to some of the company, but will not
forego his joke for the sake of others—the
social bully who makes butts of the more
retiring, and sallies at their expense, is
the most obvious case of a man failing
from selfishness, and losing the great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>natural advantages he possesses through
want of the opposite quality. This is the
man too who interrupts others, who refuses
to exercise for a moment that patience
which he so often exacts.</p>

<p class='c008'>I have spoken of these people as failures,
and such they really are, in the truest and
highest sense, for they certainly kill more
conversation than they create, nor do they
understand that the very meaning of the
word implies a contribution-feast, an <i>eranos</i>
as the Greeks would say, not the entertainment
provided by a single host. But
alas! in a lesser and looser sense these
people often dominate society for years,
and are even sought out as social conveniences,
who will keep things going at
a dinner table, and supply the defects of
silence and dulness so painfully common
in English more than in other societies.
But the punishment of the selfish talker
is sure to come at last, when he lives till
his vivacity and his power of acquiring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>new things fail, while he still presumes
on his old reputation. He is then discovered
to be an intolerable bore, which,
indeed from a higher point of view, was
always the case; and thereupon society,
which is as selfish as he is, and insists on
being amused at all costs, throws him
aside with contempt. He has perhaps
still one place of refuge; he may become
a high priest in that great modern temple
of selfishness—his club; but even there
his popularity has waned, and he sinks
into the old age unfriended and unsociable—ἄφιλον
ἀπροσὀμιλον—which Sophocles
regarded as one of the tragic features in
the life of man.</p>

<p class='c008'><a id='s20'></a>§ 20. I turn now to a far more common,
but less observed and less censured
case of social selfishness, which
requires urgently to be brought into
the light of criticism. No man requires
to practise unselfishness more than the
silent man; for as everybody is able
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>to contribute and ought to contribute
something, so the man who thrusts himself
into society to enjoy the talk of
others, and will take no trouble to help, to
suggest, or to encourage, is really a serious
criminal. I have known a person of good
position, and not the least wanting in
brains, who would insist in sitting at dinner
between the two most agreeable people in
the room, in order that he might eat and
listen, while under no circumstances would
he make the smallest effort to entertain in
return. These silent people not only take
all they can get in society for nothing,
but they take it without the smallest gratitude,
and have the audacity afterwards to
censure those who have laboured for their
amusement.</p>

<p class='c008'>I ask the reader’s pardon for illustrating
this important fact by a personal anecdote.
In a country house where I was staying,
the host had invited the colonel commanding
a neighbouring dèpôt and his wife to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>dinner, and the conversation was flagging
seriously. Some mention of New Zealand
in that day’s papers suggested it as a topic,
upon which a couple of us brought out all
we knew about New Zealand, discussed
the natives, then savages generally, and so
restored the fortunes of the evening. The
colonel and his wife still sat silent. When
they were gone, we said to the host that
we thought it very hard work to entertain
people who would not say anything to
anybody. He replied that they <i>had</i>
said something as they got into their
carriage. What was it? The colonel
observed that it was very impertinent of
people to talk about countries they had
never seen, especially in presence of a man
like himself, who had not only lived for
years in New Zealand, but had written a
book about it! This was the thanks we
got.</p>

<p class='c008'><a id='s21'></a>§ 21. There is another special scope
for unselfishness in society, which may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>fitly find its place here. In every company
there may be people either socially
or intellectually inferior to the rest, who
feel themselves somewhat <i>out of it</i> (to
use a vulgar phrase), and whom the selfish
man, the big talker, the ambitious
man is apt to ignore. And yet these
very people may be in possession of
knowledge or of mental qualities which
will be of the highest value in conversation.
It requires unselfishness to watch
them, to appeal to their sympathies, to
draw them into the stream and make
them feel that instead of being outsiders
they are really among people anxious to
know what they think and hear what
they have to say. Many a time have I
seen an unknown and obscure person
drawn in this way and become the leading
feature in a delightful evening, for fresh
and curious knowledge, which suddenly
springs from an unexpected source, can
hardly fail to be profoundly interesting,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>and to stimulate all the active minds that
hear it. Thus I remember a stupid
young man successfully probed by an
intelligent person, till it accidentally came
out that he knew all about the wild cattle
in Lord Tankerville’s park (Chillingham
Forest). From that moment he took the
lead in the conversation, and excited a
most interesting discussion, in which
several very dull country farmers took
an animated interest.</p>

<p class='c008'>All this can be done by mere intellectual
unselfishness, by the man or woman
who considers that each person in a
society should be attended to, and if
possible compelled to contribute to the
general entertainment. But it is both
rare to find this kind of unselfishness
and difficult to apply it without
the subsidiary faculty or constitution
of mind, which many think the whole
root of good conversation—I mean
sympathy.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'><span class='sc'>Sympathy</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c022'><a id='s22'></a>§ 22. The great Adam Smith, in a
book called <i>Moral Sentiments</i>, which he
seems to have thought out as a sort of
antidote to the selfishness of the <i>Wealth
of Nations</i>,<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c021'><sup>[5]</sup></a> managed to deduce all the
virtues from this one root of sympathy.
Starting from the fact that man is a
gregarious animal, with social instincts,
he showed that the desire to be in sympathy
with our fellow-creatures, and so
command their love and respect, made us
watch them, consider what they felt about
us, and avoid everything which might
shock or hurt their opinions or their feelings.
It was this indefinite and impersonal
public opinion which was by degrees
made a part of ourselves, and under the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>name of conscience was set up as ‘a man
within the breast’ of each of us to approve
and disapprove even our most secret
actions.</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f5'>
<p class='c012'><span class='label'><a href='#r5'>5</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Cf. on the relation of these two books, the highly
interesting passage in H. T. Buckle’s chapter on the
development of the Scotch intellect in his famous
<i>History of Civilisation</i>.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c008'>I quote this once famous theory here,
to show how a great thinker, probably the
greatest of his age, estimated the force
and influence of sympathy; and whatever
exaggerations he may have made concerning
it in the province of morals, it
seems hard to over-estimate it in the
province of social intercourse. The first
condition of any conversation at all, is
that people should have their minds so
far in sympathy that they are willing to
talk upon the same subject, and to hear
what each member of the company
thinks about it. The higher condition
which now comes before us is, that the
speaker, apart from the matter of the
conversation, feels an interest in his
hearers as distinct persons, whose opinions
and feelings he desires to know.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>This is the real secret of the power of
personal beauty in society. Only a very
small number of people will fall in love
with each beautiful man or woman. But
nearly every one will be so far attracted
by beauty that he will pay attention to
what the beautiful person says, and feel
a keen interest to know what mind and
temper accompanies such perfection of
form. Thus personal beauty secures the
sympathy of any company, so much so,
that even when found out to be a mere
shell, with no mental force behind it, the
attraction lasts, and lends some charm to
what would otherwise be called trivial
and stupid. This natural sympathy with
beauty of external form is a sort of symbol
of the feeling which seeks for any mental
beauty or advantage to be found in a company,
and by showing an interest in it,
disposes the possessor of it to expand and
become friendly in response to such appreciation.
The sympathetic man will feel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>that his company talk best about the
things they know best, or have had
special opportunities of learning, and he
will be naturally anxious to find the
best side of them, and to exhibit it
by his suggestions. And as in every
conversation there must not only be good
talking but good listening, the intellectual
gifts which make the talker are often
marred if he has not the sympathy which
makes the listener.</p>

<p class='c008'>This remark suggests that the social
virtues of the sexes are broadly distinguished
by some such principle. Women
ought not to be obliged to lead in a conversation,
but it will grow dry and dull
if they are not ready with their sympathy
to hear what is said with pleasure, and to
stimulate others by quick and intelligent
appreciation. I have known a clever
woman maintain a deservedly high character
for her conversation who really said
very little, but was so sympathetic that she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>made her guests eloquent, and thus so
thoroughly pleased with themselves, that
she was lit up by the glow of their satisfaction,
and earned very justly the credit
for talking well simply because she made
others talk. There is probably no social
talent higher than this—or rarer.</p>

<p class='c008'><a id='s23'></a>§ 23. But I suppose no one will be disposed
to dispute this, or to underrate the
value of sympathy as a quality for conversation.
It is much more likely that
people may think to simplify the whole
matter by arguing that, with the postulate
of some brains and some education, all
that is required is sympathy, and the
more of it the better, so that nothing else
remains to be said. We must, therefore,
consider carefully how far this is true,
and whether there be not some important
limitations which complicate the
question.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is one on the very surface. Sympathy
must not be excessive in quality,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>which makes it demonstrative, and therefore
likely to repel its object. We have
an excellent word which describes the
over-sympathetic person, and marks the
judgment of society, when we say that he
or she is <i>gushing</i>. Of course as women
are more frequently endowed with this
virtue than men, they also err more
frequently in the excess, at least in
Teutonic races, for among Latin races a
gushing man is quite a common phenomenon.
This sort of person not only
volunteers to show his sympathy before it
is required, and often spoils conversation
at the outset, but is ever ready to agree
with everybody, so making a discussion,
which implies differences in opinion, impossible.
There results a social impression
of a mixed kind, which is even more
disagreeable than downright dislike, and
therefore socially worse—I mean that of
feeling a dislike and contempt for a person
who is known to be full of goodness and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>benevolence. Many people resent being
obliged to confuse their judgment in this
way, and feel a stronger antipathy to this
marred goodness than to proclaimed evil.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the next place, sympathy must not
be excessive in quantity or indiscriminate,
otherwise it ceases to have any great
social value. The most seductive way of
conveying your sympathy to another is to
join with him in some strong antipathy,
thus showing that all the world cannot
claim your friendship, but that you
distribute your likes and dislikes with
judgment and discrimination. A man
who is known to have a special sympathy
for some particular age or sex or class in
society is far more agreeable to that class
than he who embraces all the world in his
affections. Nay, if one usually reserved or
shy expands for once, or to some few
people, in contrast to his usual habit, this
sympathy is indeed treasured as a real
token of confidence.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>These and many similar observations,
which will occur to the intelligent reader,
will indicate how important are the limitations
of sympathy, and how essential
it is that this, like every other social
virtue, should be carefully husbanded, and
not squandered at random without regard
to its value. I should add that the foregoing
remarks are specially applicable to
English (I do not mean English-speaking)
society. There is no people more distant
and reserved in social intercourse, or that
more resents any display of feeling, most
of all of sympathy, without a careful
introduction and considerable intimacy
among the company. Thus those who
are accustomed to freer and more outspoken
societies, not to say French and
Italian life, may make social mistakes in
England on the score of sympathy, which
are sins only in the heavy atmosphere
of Anglo-Saxon manners.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'><span class='sc'>Moral Conditions—Tact</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c022'><a id='s24'></a>§ 24. The highest and best of all the
moral conditions for conversation is what
we call <i>tact</i>. I say a condition, for it is
very doubtful whether it can be called a
single and separate quality; more probably
it is a combination of intellectual
quickness with lively sympathy. But so
clearly is it an intellectual quality, that of
all others it can be greatly improved, if
not actually acquired, by long experience
in society. Like all social excellences it
is almost given as a present to some
people, while others with all possible
labour never acquire it. As in billiard-playing,
shooting, cricket, and all these
other facilities which are partly mental
and partly physical, many never can
pass a certain point of mediocrity; but
still even those who have the talent must
practise it, and only become really distinguished
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>after hard work. So it is in art.
Music and painting are not to be attained
by the crowd. Not even the just criticism
of these arts is attainable without certain
natural gifts; but a great deal of practice
in good galleries and at good concerts,
and years spent among artists, will do
much to make even moderately-endowed
people sound judges of excellence.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tact, which is the sure and quick judgment
of what is suitable and agreeable in
society, is likewise one of those delicate
and subtle qualities or a combination of
qualities which is not very easily defined,
and therefore not teachable by fixed
precepts; but we can easily see that it is
based on all the conditions we have already
discussed. Some people attain it
through sympathy; others through natural
intelligence; others through a calm temper;
others again by observing closely the
mistakes of their neighbours. As its
name implies, it is a sensitive touch in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>social matters, which feels small changes
of temperature, and so guesses at changes
of temper; which sees the passing cloud
on the expression of one face, or the
eagerness of another that desires to bring
out something personal for others to
enjoy. This quality of tact is of course
applicable far beyond mere actual conversation.
In nothing is it more useful
than in preparing the right conditions
for a pleasant society, in choosing the
people who will be in mutual sympathy, in
thinking over pleasant subjects of talk
and suggesting them, in seeing that all
disturbing conditions are kept out, and
that the members who are to converse
should be all without those small inconveniences
which damage society so vastly
out of proportion to their intrinsic importance.</p>

<p class='c008'><a id='s25'></a>§ 25. This social skill is generally supposed
to be congenital, especially in some
women, and no one thinks of laying down
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>rules for it, as its application is so constant,
various, and often sudden. Yet it
is certain that any one may improve himself
by reflection on the matter, and so
avoid those shocking mistakes which arise
from social stupidity. Thus in the company
of a woman who is a man’s third
wife, most people will instinctively avoid
jokes about Blue Beard, or anecdotes of
comparison between a man’s several wives,
of which so many are current in Ireland.
But quite apart from instinct, an experienced
man who is going to tell a story
which may have too much point for some of
those present, will look round and consider
each member of the party, and if there be a
single stranger there whose views are not
familiar to him, he will forego the pleasure
of telling the story rather than make the
social mistake of hurting even one of the
guests. On the other hand, this very
example shows how a single stranger may
spoil a whole conversation by inducing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>caution in the speakers and imposing
upon them such reserve as is inconsistent
with a perfectly easy flow of talk.</p>

<p class='c008'>Another evidence of tact is the perception
that a topic has been sufficiently
discussed, and that it is on the point of
becoming tedious. There is nothing
which elderly people should watch more
carefully in themselves, for even those
once gay and brilliant are almost certain
to become prosy with age, and to dwell
upon their favourite topics as if this preference
were shared by all society. But
even the young must be here perpetually
upon the watch, and show their tact by
refraining from too many questions or too
much argument upon any single subject,
which becomes a bore to others.<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c021'><sup>[6]</sup></a> Every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>host and hostess should make it their first
duty to watch this human weakness, and
should lead away the conversation when
it threatens to stay in the same groove.
It is better to do this bluntly and confessedly
than to refrain from doing it.
But the quality of tact, as it quickly perceives
the growing mischief, is also quick
of resource in devising such interruptions
as may seem natural or unavoidable, so as
to beguile the company into new paths,
and even make the too persistent members
lay aside their threadbare discussion without
regret.</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f6'>
<p class='c012'><span class='label'><a href='#r6'>6</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Even too careful an attention to grammar, and the
careful rounding of periods in easy intercourse, is apt
to be tedious, and should be avoided. The instant
the company has grasped your idea, you should pass
to something else without regard to the form of your
sentence.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'><span class='sc'>Conditions too General—Moral Worth and Truthfulness</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c022'><a id='s26'></a>§ 26. In all the faculties hitherto enumerated,
it has been my principle to
select and specify those which are capable
of improvement by conscious training. I
have over and over again admitted that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>nature—probably meaning by nature
<i>heredity</i>—has endowed some people with
gifts which others must strive to attain by
exercise. But I have hitherto excluded
such conditions as are either too wide to
be called conditions of conversation, or
too special ever to be attained without
great and peculiar natural gifts.</p>

<p class='c008'>Of the first kind are general moral
worth and truthfulness, which afford the
proper ground for respect, and which
therefore give weight and importance to
anything the speaker says. In cases of
moral doubt, in cases of disputed fact, the
authority of such a person is a welcome
haven of rest for those that distrust other
evidence, and like a great authority in a
science expounding the principles of that
science, so a man or woman of high character
may be of much service in conversation.
But of course it would be ridiculous
to recommend the cultivation of this lofty
character for the sake of conversation. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>is perhaps more practical to observe that
an over-seriousness in morals may be detrimental
to the ease and grace, above all to
the playfulness, of talk. Let me not be
misunderstood in this matter. There is
no more valuable and useful check on the
degenerating of talk into ribaldry, profanity,
or indecency, than the presence of a
mind of solid moral worth, which will not
tolerate such licence. There are companies,
especially of young men, where such
things are taken for wit, and which thus
show a degradation of the conception of
talk that would very soon render conversation
intolerable to any intelligent man,
not only from its coarseness, but from its
dulness. No man, no society, can be
called witty, which has not far better
credentials than that. Every company of
men ought to import two or three grave
and reverend people into their circle for
the purpose of checking such ruinous
excesses, if there be any probability that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>the conversation may stray into this slough
of mire.</p>

<p class='c008'><a id='s27'></a>§ 27. But on the other hand, there is
such a thing in society—Aristotle saw it
long ago—as being over-scrupulous in
truthfulness. Even a consummate liar,
though generally vulgar, and therefore
offensive, is a better ingredient in a company
than the scrupulously truthful man,
who weighs every statement, questions
every fact, and corrects every inaccuracy.
In the presence of such a social scourge
I have heard a witty talker pronounce it
the golden rule of conversation to <i>know
nothing accurately</i>. Far more important
is it, in my mind, to <i>demand</i> no accuracy.
There is no greater or more common
blunder in society than to express disbelief
or scepticism in a story told <i>for the
amusement of the company</i>. The object
of the speaker is not to instruct, but to
divert, and to ask him: Is that really true?
or to exclaim: Really that is too much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>to expect us to believe! shows that the
objector is a blockhead unfit for any
amusing conversation. The only social
criticism on such a story, if it be really
beyond the bounds of reasonable belief,
is to out-do it with another still more
extravagant, and so to bring back the
company with laughter, and by excess of
exaggeration to a soberer vein. The
seriousness of the blunder just noted is
not felt till we have learned that there is
a vast number of real facts in nature so
strange at first hearing, that they excite
active scepticism, and that you may lay
a wager with any one to pass them off as
lies. In fact, any society only familiar
with one class of natural facts, can be
furnished with facts from another sphere
in nature which the majority will disbelieve.<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c021'><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f7'>
<p class='c012'><span class='label'><a href='#r7'>7</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>For example, to men of town life, or of mere books,
it will seem incredible that a fish should shoot flies with
a drop of water, or a diver carry about its egg hugged
against its breast, or that an otter should take a single
bite out of a salmon and leave the rest, or that a woodcock
should carry its young in its bill, all of which facts
in natural history I have myself heard told to intelligent
pedants, and set down by them as impudent inventions.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>The point of importance in the present
connection is that, if a man is reporting
what he knows to be true, and finds himself
disbelieved, he will certainly either
feel hurt, or will conceive such contempt
for the ignorance and bad manners of his
hearers that he will make no further
effort to help the conversation.</p>

<p class='c008'>The outcome, therefore, of what has
here been said about high moral worth and
extreme truthfulness, is that these virtues,
though lending the speaker dignity, must
not be allowed to tyrannise. The great
and good man must unbend; he must acquiesce
in being amused; he must even
connive at inaccuracies, and smile at
what he considers inventions; he must
for the nonce regard recreation as his
direct object.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'><span class='sc'>Conditions too Special—Wit and Humour</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c022'><a id='s28'></a>§ 28. There may have been times and
nations where conversation was regarded
as so serious and important an engine of
education, that sound argument, brilliant
illustration, and ample information, took
the highest place as qualities of talk.
Perhaps they do in some cases now, as,
for example, everybody who knows him
will concede to Mr. Gladstone the palm
as a very charming man in society by
reason of these qualities. But among
hard-working and somewhat fatigued
people, who have been pursuing information
of various kinds in all their working
hours, conversation must be of the nature
of relaxation; it must be amusing first,
instructive afterwards, and so it is that
nowadays no qualities, however valuable,
rank so high in popular estimation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>for social purposes, as wit and
humour.</p>

<p class='c008'>I will not ascend to a philosophical
analysis of these terms, or attempt to
answer the obscure and difficult question:
What is it that makes us laugh,
and why we seem to have in this
somewhat trivial point a special feature
distinguishing us from all the lower animals?
They may have the faculty of
reason; they seem entirely devoid of the
faculty of ridicule. Nay, even in the
scale of civilisation, it is remarkable that
the savage and the ignorant laugh less
and understand less of this great fund of
enjoyment than civilised people. There
are also, of course, national differences.
The English boor seldom laughs, and
then at very coarse fun; the Italian or
the Irishman often, and very innocently;
the modern Greek, though highly intelligent
and keen, very seldom, apparently
from want of taste for the ridiculous.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>As regards the distinction between wit
and humour, all I need here insist upon
is that the former consists in quick flashes,
in prompt repartee, in quaint comparison;
while the latter is sustained; it is a comic
way of looking at serious things, a flavouring
of narrative, a perception of a ludicrous
vein in human life and character. Both
these are now esteemed very highly, perhaps
beyond their value, in society, but
they are so specially natural gifts, and
are so impossible to attain by practice,
that they cannot be enjoined as conditions
to which every talker must conform; they
can only be described, and their force or
weakness illustrated.</p>

<p class='c008'><a id='s29'></a>§ 29. There is nothing that requires to
<i>appear</i> spontaneous more stringently than
either of these qualities, and yet we read
of great wits, like Sheridan, who carefully
prepared their sallies, and even suborned
some one to lead up to them. The effect
of knowing this is to detract greatly from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>the enjoyment of the company, and still
more from the reputation of the speaker.
Most of us would say, that however brilliant
in writing comedies, Sheridan must
have been distinctly wanting in that
gift of spontaneous and ready wit which
flashes out at the least provocation, and
is mere intellectual playfulness, like the
playfulness of a young and happy animal.</p>

<p class='c008'>So strongly do we feel this in Irish
society, where wit is less uncommon than
elsewhere, and where it is no less highly
prized, that a kind of social religion warns
us not to study it beforehand, and any one
suspected of coming out with prepared
smart things is received by the company
with ridicule. Yet for all that, it cannot
possibly be denied that as most of the
brilliant things which a man uses in any
conversation must be at second hand—to
invent such things one after another
at the moment being beyond the power
of human genius—they must depend
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>upon a good memory, and this may best
be aided by having things written down,
which would else escape and be lost.</p>

<p class='c008'>We should therefore conclude that
every man who goes into society, and has
an inclination for that kind of conversation,
ought to keep some record of the
happy trifles he hears upon various occasions.
But it seems, at least in Ireland,
as if the repugnance to doing this
amounted to a conclusive argument
against it. It is assumed that as surely
as a man has such a store, which he looks
up beforehand, so surely will he force the
conversation towards his points, or bring
them in when irrelevant; and an irrelevant
joke is hardly a real joke. I have
known, indeed, of a college Don having a
note-book of wit in his pocket, and peeping
at it under the table to refresh his
memory. This was regarded as far the
best joke about him, and the laughter
before he spoke was always greater than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>when he had sped his shaft. In actual
society it has never occurred to me to
meet any one who has sustained a reputation
for wit in this way. We think that
if the suggestion of the current conversation
is not strong enough to bring up a
smart point naturally, and without effort,
it is better that it should be forgotten or
unsaid. Let me add the significant fact,
that in spite of endless attempts, no
printed collection of jokes has ever attained
even a decent position in literature.<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c021'><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f8'>
<p class='c012'><span class='label'><a href='#r8'>8</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I believe I should mention Dean Ramsay’s well-known
book as an exception.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c008'>So much for wit; the case of humour
is slightly different.</p>
<div class='pbb'>
 <hr class='pb c005' />
</div>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'><span class='sc'>Humour</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c022'><a id='s30'></a>§ 30. If wit be the quick flash, the
electric spark, the play of summer lightning
which warms the colour of conversation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>humour is the sustained side
of the ridiculous, the comic way of looking
at things and people, which may be
manifested either in comment upon the
statements made by others or in narrating
one’s own experiences. Of course
in receiving and commenting upon what
is being said, no preparation is possible.
It depends altogether upon a mental attitude,
which looks out with a smile upon
the world, and exposes the ridiculous side
of human life not more by irony of comment
than by mock approval of social
vices, mock indignation at social virtues,
seriousness when false comedy is being
produced, raillery when false tragedy is
being paraded with insincerity or empty
bombast. In these and a hundred other
ways humour receives and criticises what
other people say in a company; and if
it be coupled <i>with kindliness of heart and
with tact</i>, may be regarded as the very
highest of conversational virtues.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>Analogous to this is the display of
humour, not in receiving but in producing
ideas in company. The humourist is the
only good and effective story-teller; for if
he is to monopolise a conversation, and
require others to listen to him, it must be
by presenting human life under a fresh
and piquant aspect—in fact, as a little
comedy. Thus the lifelike portrayal of
any kind of foible—pomposity, obsequiousness,
conceit, hypocrisy, nay even of
provincial accent or ungrammatical language—ensures
a pleased and therefore
agreeable audience, and opens the way for
easy and sympathetic intercourse. It is
perhaps not too much to say that in any
society where conventionality becomes a
threatening power, humour is our great
safeguard from this kind of vulgarity. Let
me point as an illustration of this to the
social sketches in <i>Punch</i>, which for years
back have been the truest mirror of the
vulgarities of English society. The humorous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>exhibition of these foibles is the most
effective way we know of bringing them
before the public mind, and of warning
people that here is a judge whose censure
is really to be feared. We may also learn
from the success of this extraordinary
paper how much more valuable and more
respected prepared humour is than prepared
wit. The jokes in the text pass by
unheeded, while the sketches of character
are thought deserving of a permanent place
in our literature.</p>

<p class='c008'><a id='s31'></a>§ 31. I need hardly add that the abuse
of these great natural gifts is not only
possible, but frequent, and in both it arises
from the same mental defects—conceit
and selfishness. A man who can say a
good thing or make a person appear ridiculous
may be so proud of his power that he
exercises it at the cost of good taste and
even of real humanity. The great wit is
often cruel, and even glories in wounding
to the quick the sensibilities of others. If
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>he can carry some of the company with
him he has a wicked enjoyment in making
one of the rest a butt or target for
his shafts, and so destroying all wholesome
conversation. He may leave in the
minds of his society an admiration of his
talent, but often a serious dislike of his
character. With such feelings abroad he
will injure conversation far more than he
promotes it. People may consent to go
into his company to hear him talk, but
will avoid talking in his presence.</p>

<p class='c008'>The excesses of the humourist are perhaps
rather those of a complacent selfishness,
which does not hesitate to monopolise
the company with long stories in which all
do not feel an interest. But humour is its
own antidote; and if a man have the true
vein in him he will also have the tact to
feel when he is tedious, and when his fun
is out of harmony with his hearers. For
these reasons it is not only a higher but a
safer gift than wit for the purposes of conversation;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>the pity of it is that so few possess
it, and that there is hardly any use in
trying to attain it by education. No doubt
the constant society of an elder or superior
who looks at things in this way may
stimulate it in the young, but with the
danger of making them sarcastic and
satirical, which are grave faults, and which
are the distortion of humour to ill-natured
and unsocial purposes, so that even in
this view of the matter education in
humour may turn out a very mischievous
failure.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the whole we must set ourselves to
carry on society and to make good conversation
without any large help from
these brilliant but dangerous gifts. Occasional
flashes will occur to ordinary people,
and sometimes the very circumstances
themselves will create a situation so
humorous that it requires no genius to
bring it home to the company. But beyond
the necessary cautions above indicated,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>we cannot bring it into any systematic
doctrine of social intercourse.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'><span class='sc'>Objective Conditions. The Company—Its Number</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c022'><a id='s32'></a>§ 32. We have now exhausted all the
conditions which lie in the speaker,
which must be brought by him into a
society as the subjective conditions of
good conversation. Let us turn to the
company, regarded as the object with
which he is to deal, and see what an
analysis of its varieties may teach us in
the way of practical direction.</p>

<p class='c008'>The very first and most obvious division
is that of quantity. You may be required
to converse either with one person, with a
few, or with many. And though no
agreeable person may take the trouble to
think about it, he nevertheless makes considerable
modifications in his talk according
to these circumstances. Thus a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>colloquy with a single person, which is
the easiest form, for it is usually with
some one who is not a stranger, and it
allows far more personality, should consist
in a direct interchange of serious opinion,
in which each seeks to make the other
speak out in confidence his inmost character.
You should turn the conversation
upon the other person’s life, inquire into
his or her history, so far as that can be
done with good taste and without impertinence,
and so induce him (or her) to give
personal recollections or confessions, which
are to the teller of them generally of the
deepest interest. But you will not elicit
these without some frankness on your own
part, sometimes without volunteering some
slight confession which may induce the
other to open the flood-gates of his inner
life. When this is once attained there
must ensue good conversation; for to
have a volume of human character laid
open before you, and to turn over its pages
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>at leisure, is one of the highest and most
intense recreations known to an intelligent
mind. Such confessions will hardly ever
be made to more than one person at a
time, and a sympathetic freedom in encouraging
the timid by giving parallel experiences
in your own life will often make a
silent and reserved person agreeable who
could never be induced to speak out in a
larger company.</p>

<p class='c008'>As our manners and customs determine
these things, it is not usual to have a long
<i>tête-à-tête</i> with another person of the same
sex without choosing your companion and
seeking out the opportunity; but, on the
contrary, two people of different sexes are
often brought together and ordered (so to
speak) to converse, for no other reason
than the command of society. Thus a
young man is introduced to a partner at a
ball, or a man of soberer age is directed
to take a lady down to dinner. Here,
though the company is large, the conversation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>is really of the kind before us—a
dialogue between two persons only, of
different sexes, and often comparative
strangers. There is no case more frequent
where conversation is imperative,
and where failures are common and conspicuous.
It is bad enough to begin with
truisms about the weather—an excusable
exordium; it is far worse and more disgraceful
to end with them, and positively
many people get no further. And yet
this failure is not from mere emptiness of
mind. These very same people, young
and old, could be brought into circumstances
where almost any of them would be
interesting—not a few of them eloquent.</p>

<p class='c008'>I have spent an evening shut up
with a very unpromising commercial traveller
in a remote country inn, and yet
by trying honestly to find out what he
knew and liked, succeeded in drawing
from him a most interesting account of
his experiences, first in tea-tasting, then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>in tea-selling to the Irish peasants in
the remote glens of Donegal. What he
told me was quite worthy to make an
article in a good magazine. Yet a more
unpromising subject for a long dialogue
could hardly be found. He and I had apparently
not a single interest in common.
But when the right vein was touched one
had to supply nothing but assent, or an
occasional question; the man flowed on
with an almost natural eloquence. People
said that others had found him morose
and unapproachable. It was certainly
their fault. This case is cited as an instance
that almost anybody can be made
to talk, unless he has determined positively
that he will not do so, and is moreover
a very obstinate person.</p>

<p class='c008'><a id='s33'></a>§ 33. In the cases with which we started
no such obstinacy exists; the people are
really ready to talk, but don’t know how.
The beginning is evidently the difficulty,
and surely here, if anywhere, people who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>have no natural facility should think out
some way of opening the conversation,
just as chessplayers have agreed on several
formal openings in their game. Nothing
is easier than to do this, and to do it in
such a general manner as will not be
ridiculous. It must always be remembered
that the most domestic men and women
are often the most difficult to rouse into
conversation. Their very virtues in home
life have dulled their interests in outer
things, and the best of mothers have sometimes
forgotten to talk about anything
except the education of their children.
But it is always better worth probing a
sound nature than hearing the ready chatter
of idleness. For this reason, some serious
topic ought to be the best, even for talking
with a stranger, since our conversation
errs more frequently through frivolity than
through gravity.</p>

<p class='c008'>But it is not the object of this book to
give any special directions. They are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>only useful when framed by each man and
woman for their own private use, and any
stock proceeding becomes a mere commonplace,
and as such contemptible. Yet no
intelligent person who thinks over it can
fail to make out some general lines to be
followed on such occasions, and so thousands
of men and women will save themselves
from the punishment of a dull and
tedious evening beside a person whom
they might easily find lively and agreeable.</p>

<p class='c008'>As there are some people who require
to be encouraged by finding out their daily
interests, and inquiring into them, so there
are others who are only to be excited by
the stimulus of opposition, by suggesting
some opinion adverse to what they believe
or advocate, and so tempting them to a
friendly controversy. If you enter such a
controversy with perfectly good temper,
with a desire to be convinced by good
arguments, and no further interest than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>to bring out the latent fire in the other
person, it may produce a very good conversation.
But the moment you find the
points of difference too strongly accentuated,
the moment you perceive the dissatisfaction
which is so common in people who
are losing ground, or who feel they are
making no impression, you should turn
the stream into another channel, in which
you anticipate at least partial agreement.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'><span class='sc'>Talking with a Few</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c022'><a id='s34'></a>§ 34. These last remarks are very applicable
to the case next before us, when
conversation is among a few—say from
four to eight people—a form of society
the best and most suitable for talk, but
which is now rather the exception, from
the common habit of crowding our rooms
or our tables, and getting rid of social
obligations as if they were commercial
debts. Indeed many of our young people
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>have so seldom heard a general conversation
that they grow up in the belief that
their only duty in society will be to talk
to one man or woman at a time. So
serious are the results of the fashion of
large dinner-parties. For really good
society no dinner-table should be too
large to exclude general conversation, and
no couples should sit together who are
likely to lapse into private discourse.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is generally thought the fault of the
host or hostess if such an evening turns
out a failure;<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c021'><sup>[9]</sup></a> and indeed it is possible to
bring one incongruous person into a small
company, who will so chill or disturb the
rest that conversation languishes. But
this case is rare, and the fault usually lies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>with the company, none of whom take the
trouble to tide over any difficulty, or seek
to draw out from those present what they
like or want to say. I am now looking
at the thing from the point of view of
the man or woman who comes in as a
guest, and whose duty it is to make the
evening, or the period of time during
which the company is assembled, pass in
a pleasant way. Perhaps it is the practical
course to consider the usual form
in modern society, that of the small
dinner-party, and then apply what is to
be said upon it to analogous cases.</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f9'>
<p class='c012'><span class='label'><a href='#r9'>9</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It is right to add that there are hosts, and hostesses
so anxious for the good entertainment of their friends
that this preoccupation spoils their own enjoyment, and
so far defeats the very object they have in view. But
people so truly desirous of giving pleasure can hardly
avoid being pleasant in a better sense than those who do
not feel their responsibilities so acutely.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c008'>In the very forefront there stares us in
the face that very awkward period which
even the gentle Menander notes as the
worst possible for conversation, the short
time during which people are assembling,
and waiting for the announcement of
dinner. If the witty man were not
usually a selfish person, who will not
exhibit his talent without the reward of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>full and leisurely appreciation, this is
the real moment to show his powers.
A brilliant thing said at the very
start, which sets people laughing, and
makes them forget that they are waiting,
may alter the whole complexion of the
party, may make the silent and distant
people feel themselves drawn into
the sympathy of common merriment, and
thaw the iciness which so often fetters
Anglo-Saxon society. But as this faculty
is not given to many, so the average man
may content himself with having something
ready to tell, and this, if possible, in
answer to the usual question expressed or
implied: Is there any news this afternoon?
There are few days that the daily
papers will not afford to the intelligent
critic something ridiculous either in style
or matter which has escaped the ordinary
public; some local event, nay, even some
local tragedy, may suggest a topic not
worth more than a few moments of attention,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>which will secure the interest of
minds vacant, and perhaps more hungry
to be fed than their bodies. Here then,
if anywhere in the whole range of conversation,
the man or woman who desires
to be agreeable may venture to think
beforehand, and bring with them something
ready, merely as the first kick or
starting point to make the evening run
smoothly.</p>

<p class='c008'><a id='s35'></a>§ 35. When the company has settled
down to dinner, the first care should be
to prevent it breaking into couples, and
for that purpose some one opposite should
be addressed or some question asked
which may evoke answers from various
people. Above all, however, the particular
guest of the night, or the person best
known as a wit or story-teller, should <i>not</i>
be pressed or challenged at the outset—a
sort of vulgarity which makes him either
shy or angry at being so manifestly <i>exploité</i>
by the company, so that he is likely either
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>to turn silent or say some ill-humoured
things.</p>

<p class='c008'>The main advice to be given to women
to help them in making such a small
company agreeable, is to study politics.
A vast number of clever and well-read
women exclude themselves from a large
part of the serious talk of men by neglecting
this engrossing and ever-fruitful topic
of conversation. Literature, of course, is a
still more various and interesting subject;
but here perhaps the defect lies with men,
who are so devoted to practical life that
they lose their taste for general reading.
Except for politics, the daily papers seldom
afford any literary food fit for good conversation.</p>

<p class='c008'>The topic which ought to be common
to both and always interesting, is the discussion
of human character and human
motives. If the novel be so popular a
form of literature, how can the novel in
real life fail to interest an intelligent company?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>People of serious temper and
philosophic habit will be able to confine
themselves to large ethical views, and
the general dealings of men; but to
average people, both men and women,
and perhaps most of all to busy men,
who desire to find in society relaxation
from their toil, that lighter and more personal
kind of criticism on human affairs
will prevail which is known as <i>gossip</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'><a id='s36'></a>§ 36. This may, therefore, be the suitable
moment to consider the place of
gossip in the theory of conversation; for
though gossip is not only possible but
usual in the private discourse of two
people, and possible too in a large society,
its real home and natural exercising ground
is the society of a few people intimate with
the same surroundings.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is usual for all people, especially
those who most indulge in it, to censure
gossip as a crime, as a violation of the
Ninth Commandment, as a proof of idleness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>and vain curiosity, as a frivolous
waste of the time given us for mental
improvement. Yet the censure is seldom
serious. These people cannot but feel
obscurely what they are either afraid to
speak out or have not duly considered,
that the main object of conversation is
neither instruction nor moral improvement
but <i>recreation</i>. It is of course highly
desirable that all our amusements should
be both intellectually and morally profitable,
and we may look back with
special satisfaction upon any conversation
which included these important
objects. But the main and direct object
is recreation, mental relaxation, happy
idleness; and from this point of view it
is impossible for any sound theory of
conversation to ignore or depreciate gossip,
which is perhaps the main factor in agreeable
talk throughout society.</p>

<p class='c008'>The most harmless form is the repeating
of small details about personages great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>either in position or intellect, which give
their empty names a personal colour, and
so bring them nearer and more clearly
into view. The man who has just come
from the society of kings and queens, or
great generals, or politicians, or literary
men whose names are exceptionally prominent
at the time, can generally furnish
some personal details by which people
imagine they can explain to themselves
great and unexpected results. Who has
not heard with interest such anecdotes
about Mr. Gladstone, or Prince Bismarck,
or Victor Emanuel? And what book
has ever acquired more deserved and
lasting reputation than Boswell’s <i>Life of
Johnson</i>?</p>

<p class='c008'>The latest development of the literary
side of gossip is to be seen in what are
called the ’society papers,’ which owe their
circulation to their usefulness in furnishing
topics for this kind of conversation.<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c021'><sup>[10]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>All the funny sketches of life and character
which have made <i>Punch</i> so admirable a
mirror of society for the last fifty years, are
of the character of gossip, subtracting the
mischievous element of personality; and
though most people will think this latter
an essential feature in our meaning when
we talk of gossip, it is not so; it is the
trivial and passing, the unproven and
suspected, which is the main thing, for
it is quite possible to bring any story
under the notion while suppressing the
names of the actors.</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f10'>
<p class='c012'><span class='label'><a href='#r10'>10</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I only speak of the <i>fact</i> that they are useful in supplying
a want. Whether they are or are not corrupting the
public mind is another and a very serious question.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c008'>Next to the retailing of small personal
points about great people comes the
narrating of deeper interests belonging to
small people, especially the affairs of the
heart, which we pursue so assiduously
even in feigned characters. But here it
is that all the foibles of our neighbours
come under survey, and that a great deal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>of calumny and slander may be launched
upon the world by mere shrug and innuendo.
The reader will remember with
what effect this side of gossip is brought
out in Sheridan’s <i>School for Scandal</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'><a id='s37'></a>§ 37. It is idle to deny that there is
no kind of conversation more fascinating
than this, but its immorality may easily
become such as to shock honest minds,
and the man who indulges in it freely at
the expense of others, will probably have
to pay the cost himself in the long
run; for those who hear him will fear
him, and will retire into themselves in his
presence. On the other hand, nothing is
more honourable than to stand forth as
the defender or the palliator of the faults
imputed to others, and nothing is easier
than to expand such a defence into
general considerations as to the purity
of human motives, which will raise the
conversation from its unwholesome ground
into the upper air.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>If the company be fit for it, no general
rule is more valuable than that of turning
the conversation away from people and
fixing it on things; but, alas! how many
there are who only take interest in people,
and in the weakest and most trivial
aspects of people! Few things are more
essential and more neglected in the education
of children than to habituate them
to talk about things, and not people; yet,
what use is there in urging these more
special rules, when the very idea of teaching
them to converse at all is foreign to
the minds of most parents and of all
educators? Let me illustrate this by one
grotesque fact.</p>

<p class='c008'>It will be conceded that the one thing
absolutely essential to the education of a
lady is that she should talk agreeably at
meals. It is the natural meeting time,
not only of the household, but of friends,
and conversation is then as essential as
food. Yet, what is the habit of many of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>our schools? They either enforce silence
at this period, or they compel the wretched
pupils to speak in a foreign language, in
which they can only labour out spasmodic
commonplaces, without any interchange
or play of thought. Consequently many
of our girls drift into the habit of regarding
meal-times as the precise occasion
when conversation is impossible. How far
this mis-education, during some of the
most critical years of their lives, affects
them permanently it is not easy to over-estimate.
If parents were decently intelligent
in this matter they should ascertain
clearly the practice of a school, and the
schoolmaster or schoolmistress who is
obtuse and mischievous enough to practise
this crime should at once lose every
pupil.</p>

<p class='c008'>The only excuse I can find for this
widespread outrage upon the social rights
of the young, is the old tradition of universities,
still pursued in convent schools
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>and Roman Catholic seminaries, that a
portion of scripture, or of some edifying
book, should be read out during meals,
so that the pupils may take in spiritual
food along with their dinners, and avoid
the crime of light and trivial conversation.
A clever Jesuit educator whom I knew,
went so far within the letter of the law as
to substitute the <i>Saturday Review</i> for the
usual work of edification, the <i>Lives of the
Saints</i>! This worthy man did his best
under a system devised to bring up young
people in silence and in fear, not in free
and friendly intercourse with their instructors.
But why should we, with our spiritual
liberty, retain these mischievous and
antiquated shackles?</p>
<div class='pbb'>
 <hr class='pb c005' />
</div>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'><span class='sc'>With Many</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c022'><a id='s38'></a>§ 38. Conversation with a crowd, or
even with a large number of people, is
almost a contradiction in terms. How
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>can there be interchange of thought or
repartee where so many clashing fancies
make confusion rather than harmony?
In ordinary society, therefore, it is the
obvious solution to break up a large company
into couples or small groups, and so
reduce this case to one of the preceding.
Two exceptional forms may be noted,
which come, perhaps, upon the verge of
conversation proper: the one where a good
story-teller, or person who has had some
wonderful experience, is ready to talk for
the benefit of the whole company, and
receive occasional support from questions
put to him by various people. But even
in this case the number must be limited,
and usually such a talker will seem to his
audience egotistical, for people who want
to have their little private say, and tell
their little modest story, feel ousted by
the monopoly of the leading spirit.</p>

<p class='c008'>Perhaps the pleasantest form into which
to lead such a conversation, is a sort of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>public dialogue, in which one or two
querists will draw from the real object of
attention his views, or question his statements
in such a way as to provoke the
exercise of his powers. This is the kind
of conversation to be found in Plato’s
<i>Dialogues</i>, which are quite fitted for a
large company, though but few speakers
share in them. But I will not be bound
to admire these immortal compositions
as specimens of conversation. To the
modern reader, they cease to be such as
soon as they become serious, and I may
even venture to say that in any modern
society they would justly be voted tedious.</p>

<p class='c008'><a id='s39'></a>§ 39. The second case worth noticing
here is when a leading person, king or
viceroy, or princess, or political magnate,
entertains a crowd of people mostly inferior
in station, and has to perform the
duty of going through the rooms and
talking in succession to all sorts and conditions
of men. If on the one hand the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>people addressed are sure to be flattered
by such attention, and therefore responsive
and anxious to be pleased, on the other
there is no social duty which gives more
scope for all the mental and moral perfections
already enumerated, and therefore
there is no more certain test of
conversational ability. For here the talk
is not really with many at a time, nor
again is it the conversation with one
person, in which the main element is the
sustaining of interest for a considerable
time; it is a series of brief successive
dialogues, in which the two great difficulties
of conversation, the starting of it and
the breaking off, are perpetually recurring.
The speaker is even debarred from the
use of any fixed formula or method of overcoming
these difficulties, for the people
addressed will be sure to compare notes,
and will reject as insincere any politenesses
which are administered according to a
formula, however graceful it may appear.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>Here then, if anywhere, the art must
consist in concealing the art. But let none
imagine that art has no place here. A
sympathetic nature, which readily apprehends
the interests of other minds, is not
more useful to the great man or woman
than a careful previous study of the company,
who they are, what they have done,
what the distinction or the hobby of each
of them may be. Nothing is easier than
to acquire such information from the staff
whose duty is to furnish it. A great
natural aptitude or a specially trained
memory is required to remember the
various scraps of information about each,
and to fit them to the proper names. It
is said that royal personages often inherit
an exceptional power of remembering
names and persons from the exercise of
this faculty by a long line of successive
ancestors. But the suggestion of an
equerry or a lord-in-waiting is in such
cases the usual and more obvious cause
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>of this apparent genius, which the flattery
of courtiers exaggerates with shameless
effrontery.</p>

<p class='c008'>However this may be, the knowledge,
inspired or acquired, of the name and
circumstances of an inferior is the great
key to smoothing over the difficulty of
beginning a conversation, for any personal
question will be taken as a compliment,
and evidence of a friendly interest on the
part of the prince. The breaking off
with ease and grace is more difficult, for I
do not count the formal bow of dismissal
or the prearranged interruption by a new
presentation as more than awkward subterfuges.
Some form of expressing regret
that the moment does not admit of fuller
discussion of the subject already commenced,
and a hope to resume it, is of
course an obvious and polite way of closing
the interview, or a question as to some
one else who must receive attention, or a
complaint that duty must oust pleasure—there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>are myriad possibilities, as may be
seen from the conversation of the few
great ladies in England who have the gift
or have attained the art. I mention ladies
because the traditional bluntness and
simplicity inherited, respected, assumed,
affected by most Englishmen makes them
very averse to this social grace. It is no
accident that those of our great houses
who have adopted public life after a considerable
experience of French manners,
and with a ready knowledge of the French
language, are the most brilliant exceptions.
Perhaps, too, Irish vivacity has in most
of these cases added life and brightness
to their talk. But, as a rule, it is to
women that we look for this talent, and to
older French society for the best examples
of it. One often hears it said that since
Lady Waldegrave’s death no one in London
knows how to have a <i>salon</i>. This,
whether true or false, is the popular
recognition of that social excellence in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>conversing with many, to which I have
devoted the last few pages.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'><span class='sc'>The Quality of the Company</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c022'><a id='s40'></a>§ 40. Hitherto we have regarded the
company merely from the point of quantity,
and considered them as so many
units, grouped in larger and smaller
masses. We shall now adopt a totally different
principle, and regard their <i>quality</i> in
relation to the speaker. It is obvious that
for our purpose this element must receive
careful consideration.</p>

<p class='c008'>I remember years ago occupying myself
in constructing from the epitaphs in a
country church the genealogy of the great
squire who owned the parish. Among the
stereotyped and hardly varied eulogies of
his ancestors one stood out as peculiar and
original. It was said of this magnate,
who died about the year 1830, that to
express his virtues among those that knew
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>him would be impertinent, ‘but to strangers
and to posterity let this monument declare,
that in him were combined <i>the generous
Patron, the affable Superior, the polished
Equal</i>, the uncompromising Patriot, and the
Honest Man’ The sequel was commonplace.
Nor is the social description complete,
for the dignity of the subject would
not allow the epitaphist to suggest the
virtues of his hero in the guise of an inferior.
<i>The supple courtier</i> would, from
what I have heard about him, have been
the truest addition to the picture. But
what interests us here is not only the
importance given to social talents over
morals and religion,—a truly Irish feature,—but
the accurate perception the writer
had of the various talents required according
to the quality of the people around us.</p>

<p class='c008'>If he had thought more upon the subject,
or if he had been allowed to give us
the results of his thinking, he might have
told us that the secret in all cases, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span><i>sine qua non</i> of good conversation, is to
establish equality, at least momentary, if
you like fictitious, but at all costs <i>equality</i>,
among the members of the company who
make up the party. The man who keeps
asserting his superiority, or confessing
his inferiority, is never agreeable. Nay
even, if the superiority is very marked, as
in the case of royal persons, it is almost
impossible to converse with them in the
better sense, and one of the most melancholy
penalties of this kind of greatness is,
that except within the narrow circle of
their families and equals they can never
enjoy the fresh breeze of unconstrained
society. Any truth they can learn from
their surroundings is confined to the very
poor category of pleasant truths. All
vigorous intellectual buffeting, all wholesome
contradiction which would open their
minds, is carefully avoided by courtiers,
because it is the assertion of this very
equality which is the backbone of conversation.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>It requires peculiar earnestness
and honesty on the part of a prince to
break through this crust of assentation,
and discover the real opinions of the men
around him; nor can he incur any bitterer
loss than the removal of those rare
advisers, who have the gift of combining
real liberty with formal obsequiousness,
and without violating the etiquette of the
courtier, can assume the character of the
independent critic and just adviser.</p>

<p class='c008'>But this little book is not meant for the
advice or criticism of kings, who by their
position are almost completely excluded
from conversation. The question before
us is how we ordinary people should modify
the tone of our talk according as our company
consists of people socially or intellectually
above us, of our equals, or lastly,
of our inferiors. It is evident that in
the first and last cases there is difficulty;
the second is the normal atmosphere of
conversation.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>
  <h2 class='c006'><span class='sc'>Talking with Superiors</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c022'><a id='s41'></a>§ 41. In conversing with superiors, we
must broadly distinguish the socially from
the intellectually superior. For the art of
producing agreeable society in the former
case differs widely from doing so in
the latter. Perhaps the matter may
be expressed tersely, if not quite accurately,
by saying that the necessary
equality between the members of the
company is attained in the former instance
by the good talker raising himself to the
level of his superior, in the latter by his
bringing down his superior to his own
level. A word of explanation is here
necessary. The man or woman that
succeeds among social superiors is not the
timid or modest person, afraid to contradict,
and ever ready to assent to what is
said, but rather the free and independent
intellect that suggests subjects, makes bold
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>criticisms, and in fact introduces a bright
and free tone into a company which is
perhaps somewhat dull from its grandeur
or even its extreme respectability. It is
a case of the socially superior acknowledging
another kind of superiority, which
redresses the balance. We need hardly
add that the greatest stress must here
be placed on tact, for to presume on either
kind of superiority will cause offence, and
so spoil every attempt at breaking the
bonds set around us by the grades of the
social hierarchy.</p>

<p class='c008'>If, on the contrary, we meet a man of
acknowledged mental superiority, whether
generally or in his special department, it
is our social duty by intelligent questioning,
by an anxiety to learn from him, to
force him to condescend to our ignorance,
or join in our fun, till his broader sympathies
are awakened, and he plays with us
as if we were his children. Indeed this
very metaphor points out one of the very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>remarkable instances of social equality
asserted by an inferior—I mean the outspoken
freedom of the child—which possesses
a peculiar charm, and often thaws
the dignity or dissipates the reserve of the
great man and woman whose superiority
is a perpetual obstacle to them in ordinary
society.</p>

<p class='c008'>I may here dwell a moment upon conscious
superiority and its companion, that
conscious inferiority which is the great
social barrier to conversation, and which
in most cases actually prohibits all intercourse.
In other European countries the
separation of <i>noblesse</i> and <i>bourgeoisie</i> is
carried so far as wellnigh to annihilate all
free and intellectual society of the better
kind. The intellectually-educated classes
are so thoroughly excluded from social
education in the urbanity and grace of
noble society, that they sink into mere
intellectual boors, while the aristocrats so
seldom hear any intellectual discussion or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>take any interest in learning, that their
society becomes either vapidly trivial or
professionally narrow. For these nobles
have their professions like other people,
especially the profession of arms.</p>

<p class='c008'>The case is not so bad among us, where
there are always great commoners, where
eminent success in making money, or even
in letters, brings men and women into the
highest society, and where there are some
of the greatest positions in the country
from which our Peers are even excluded.
There is no doubt that an intellectual
man, or a man of strong and recognised
character, whatever his origin, can easily
take a place in high society among us. But
how many lesser people are there of excellent
social gifts who assume most falsely
that they are not suited, and will not be
welcome, to the higher classes, and so
avoid both the pleasure and the profit to
be derived from a more refined, though
not more cultivated, stratum than their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>own! I am here talking of really modest
and worthy people, not of those vain and
vulgar persons who make it a boast—often
a very dishonest one—that they have
spurned associating with their superiors,
from a profound contempt of what they
call <i>toadyism</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'><a id='s42'></a>§ 42. This term, which expresses the
vicious relations of socially inferior and
superior, is used in very vague senses,
ranging from a just censure of meanness
in others to a mistaken assertion of independence
in ourselves. Nothing is more
inherent in all European society derived
from the feudal and ecclesiastical traditions
of the Middle Ages—probably in every
cultivated society—than to honour rank
and social dignity as such, apart from the
real worth of the person so distinguished.
This is the basis of that loyalty to sovrans
which even when irrational does
not incur the imputation of toadyism.
People of independent rank and personal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>dignity even still accept and prize
semi-menial offices about a Court, without
losing either respect among ordinary
people or even self-respect.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is then such a thing as respect for
rank as such, and a feeling of pride in the
contact with it, which is regarded as honourable.
When does the virtue of loyalty
pass into a vice? Clearly when the higher
and more important duties of life are
postponed to this love of outward dignity.
The man who neglects his equals for the
purpose of courting his superiors, still
more who confesses or asserts his inferiority
when associating with them, and
who submits to rebuffs and indignities for
the sake of being thought their associate,
above all, who condones in them vices
which he would not brook in an equal, is
justly liable to the charge, which, however,
only asserts the exaggeration of a
tendency affecting almost all his censors.</p>

<p class='c008'>The usual thing, however, is to hear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>people censured for the <i>fact</i> of associating
with those above them, as if this were
in itself a crime. There is, too, not unfrequently
an element of jealousy in our
criticism, and of secret regret that another
has attained certain advantages, or supposed
advantages, to which we ourselves
feel an equal claim. Yet one thing is
certain, that if the supposed toady exhibited
in the society which he courts
the qualities ascribed to him by his critics,
he would very soon lose his position
and miss the very object of his ambition.
The only cause of his popularity is the
very fact that his company feel him in
some respects their equal, possibly their
superior, and it is the secret of asserting
this equality with tact and courtesy which
makes men and women popular among
their superiors.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is one point of view which gives
a good talker a distinct advantage under
these circumstances. The distinctness of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>his ordinary associates from those whom
he occasionally meets makes his everyday
experience different from theirs, and so
things familiar to him and his everyday
society are often interesting and novel to
people of a different standing. He ought
therefore to be able to bring new information
to bear upon either class of society,
and so secure its interest with his store of
fresh experiences.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'><span class='sc'>With Inferiors</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c022'><a id='s43'></a>§ 43. Let us now turn to the other
side and consider the proper principles of
conversation with inferiors. And here,
too, it is more practical to take our standpoint
in the middle class of society, and
not among those who must habitually
talk to inferiors owing to their own
high condition. The same key unlocks
the secret of success. If it be
indispensable for good conversation to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>make your superiors feel you for the
time their equal, so it is indispensable
that your inferiors should feel that they
too are upon a social level with you
during their talk. Of course, the first
thing is to banish all traces of <i>condescension</i>,
that odious ape of humility
and urbanity, which is the loud expression
of want of brains and want of tact,
for it emphasises the very differences
which conversation seeks to obliterate.
On the other hand, there is an extreme
of <i>familiarity</i> which shocks and alarms
the inferior, for he justly expects a sudden
revulsion from it, as we are told in Polybius
of the common people of Antioch,
into whose humble entertainments or
amusements Antiochus Epiphanes would
come, and sit down to drink and joke
with them. These vagaries on the part
of their despotic sovran so frightened
them that they would get up and run
away. The just mean is to strike out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>a line of conversation, either of common
interest, or in which the inferior is a specialist,
and therefore your superior. He will
then feel that he is speaking with authority,
and the honest expression of your
ignorance and your desire to learn will
give him confidence to tell you freely what
he knows.</p>

<p class='c008'><a id='s44'></a>§ 44. It is in the lower ranks of society
that national differences become really
great. The highly bred or highly cultivated
people of any European nation
have attained a certain unity of type, and
are interested by the same sort of conversation;
it is very different with English,
French, Italian, and German peasants.
Nay, even within our islands, there is a
marked difference in the social abilities
of English, Scotch, and Irish peasants.
It is customary to set this down to race,
and be satisfied with some such vague
generality. But I fancy the causes of these
social differences are rather recent than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>primeval; they do not depend directly
upon climate or atmosphere, and if I
may quote the opinion of a wise friend
on this large question, I should say that
one chief cause of the talking or social
ability of some peasantries over others is
the fact that their proximate ancestors
were a bilingual people. Thus the great
majority of West Irish and North Scotch
peasants are descended from grandfathers,
whose talk oscillated between Celtic and
English, and who were therefore constantly
educated in intelligence by the problem of
<i>translating</i> ideas from one language into
another, not to mention the distinct inheritance
of the special ideas peculiar to
each and every language. This is an
education in expression, in thinking, and
therefore in conversation, wholly foreign
to the English Midland boor, who has
never heard more than two or three
hundred words of a very rude provincial
dialect of English, and therefore commands
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>neither the words nor the ideas of
the outlying provinces. A great part of
the French peasantry are likewise proximately
descended from bilingual ancestors,
French being the old language of but a
small part of their now recognised territory.
Breton, Bearnais, Provençal, Walloon,
are even still living languages in
large parts of France (as was German up
to 1871), and so the peasantry were under
like favourable conditions.</p>

<p class='c008'>But I must not diverge further from
the subject in hand. Thus much was
naturally suggested to me by the best
and most diverting conversation I know
with inferiors—that which sporting men
have with those whose livelihood has been
earned by studying the habits and ways
of fish and game. There are few men
who shoot, fish, or hunt in Ireland, who
do not know specimens of that remarkable
though small class whose natural
ability, combined with long experience,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>makes them masters of their craft, and
whose long association with their superiors
in matters of sport has given them perfect
ease and even charm of manners. Conversation
with these people, which is
often prolonged through many hours, is
not only very instructive—a secondary
matter to us now—but exceedingly amusing,
from the perfect frankness as well as
tact with which they speak their mind to
the sporting friend, whom they regard
as their inferior or equal from a professional
point of view. It is this perfect
liberty, this spiritual equality, often designated
as the free masonry of sport, from
which arises the charm of talking upon
subjects of common interest to one confessedly
inferior in many respects. But
in one he is commonly your superior,
even apart from his sport. It has been
far more important to him all his life to
study and know the characters of his
employers than it has been for them to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>study his, and so he is generally your
superior in perceiving what will please,
and what topics are to be selected
or avoided in conversation. Nothing
has struck me more in many such talks
than the acute estimate which these
people form of the strength and weakness
of those who are their patrons.</p>

<p class='c008'>These are illustrations of a general
kind, to show how inferiority in social
station may not imply inferiority for the
purposes of conversation, so that we may
even here attain that equality which I
regard as essential for its success.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'><span class='sc'>The Relations of Sex and Age</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c022'><a id='s45'></a>§ 45. So far we have been considering
the quality of the company as determined
by social position, which, if not an
absolutely artificial distinction, is at least
frequently such, so that it may be even
reversed by circumstances. There are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>great distinctions made by nature which
are indelible, and which must therefore
be reckoned with as permanent factors
in our theory—I mean those of age and
sex.</p>

<p class='c008'>There are, properly speaking, three
grades of age worth considering—youth,
maturity, and old age; but from our
point of view we are justified in regarding
mature life as the normal state, and
shall therefore consider the duties of the
mature man and woman as they come in
contact with the extremes. It is not
worth while writing any advices for the
old, as they are beyond the age of improvement,
though by no means always
stripped of their social qualities; indeed,
the position of very old people, who have
maintained their faculties, is quite exceptional
in modern society, and will require
a few words of comment in the
present connection.</p>

<p class='c008'>A collection of very old people is of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>course hardly to be found; so that the
practical case before us is the occurrence
of one, or at most two, very old people
in a company, and the consequent modifications
in ordinary society likely to
make this element effective and agreeable.
It may almost be assumed that
however lively the old person is, he (or
she) will not be able to converse when
many people are talking in the room, and
to assert himself in even a small crowd.
There must be comparative silence while
he is speaking, and special attention should
be paid him. Under these circumstances
it almost follows as a matter of course that
he should be discreetly drawn out to tell
such experiences as are beyond the
memory of the rest, which from their
pictures of bygone manners or long dead
celebrities are very interesting, and admirably
suited for the best social recreation.
The many <i>Recollections</i>, <i>Diaries</i>, <i>Autobiographies</i>,
etc., now published from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>papers of the mere observers of their age,
such as Greville, and which are generally
too trivial and minute to make good
books, form the staple of excellent conversation
when told by the very actor or
observer. Of course there is a considerable
chance of his becoming tedious; it is
one of the most frequent defects of age,
but if a man’s hobby makes him tedious,
it also may make him very interesting;
and the first and best receipt to make a
man agreeable is to make him talk about
what he likes best.</p>

<p class='c008'>The most successful conversations with
old men are, however, not those with the
old <i>raconteur</i>, who is in the habit of narrating
his experiences and expects to be
asked to do so, but with some modest and
apparently dull old person who is successfully
probed by intelligent and sympathetic
questions, till he is actually
reminded of long-forgotten scenes, which
have perhaps not been suggested to him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>for years, and then he draws from his
memory, with the help of further questions,
some passage of life and adventure of the
highest interest. Many a time have I
seen an old person, at first regarded as an
obstacle, prove the highest advantage to
the conversation, and it is for this reason
that in a book of theory the reader should
be reminded of his duty to see that so
valuable an item does not escape him.
It is generally easy enough to gather from
the old gentleman (or lady) where he has
lived, what society he has frequented, and
what are his strongest impressions as to
the contrasts between his own early days
and ours.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is, moreover, in discussing the
gossip and the scandal of a bygone
generation an amount of freedom—I had
almost said licence—allowed which would
be intolerable as regards living society,
and a very old person may be allowed to
say things which younger people should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>avoid. I do not mention this as an
advantage in itself—far from it—but as
an additional possibility in making conversation
lively, and in avoiding that
stagnation in talk which, from our present
point of view, is the extremest
crime known to society.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is also obvious that as old people
are unable to talk loudly and with vivacity,
the dialogue between two, or a couple of
listeners added to the questioner, will be
the most likely way to attain the end in
view. To stop an old person who is
becoming tedious is probably the most
difficult of all social duties, and requires
the most delicate tact. The respect
due to age takes from our hands
those weapons of sarcasm, banter, or
even blunt interruption which are our
natural defences against obtrusive youth;
nor do I know of any general directions
which can help a host or hostess in this
grave and not uncommon difficulty. It is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>of course useless to lecture old people,
either in this book or elsewhere, on the
dangers of tediousness.</p>

<p class='c008'><a id='s46'></a>§ 46. I turn now to conversation with
people much younger than ourselves, not
of course with babies, or very young
children, the art of amusing whom can
hardly be called the art of conversation.
I mean rather such ordinary cases as going
in to dinner with a person much younger
than yourself, whose main interests must
therefore be foreign to yours; or else the
entertaining of a party of young people
who have met for purposes of sport, but
are also to be regarded as guests at a table
where conversation asserts its universal
importance.</p>

<p class='c008'>What modifications in our talk are here
desirable?</p>

<p class='c008'>In the first place it is but natural that
the older person should lead the discourse,
and suggest the topics which will elicit
sympathy from the young. And of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>course the easiest way to begin is to make
people talk about themselves—this being
a subject which interests most young
people exceedingly. But it is by no
means an universal rule. The life of the
young, of schoolboys, and of young
girls, is often very monotonous, and really
affords no scope for conversation beyond
the first ordinary inquiries into their
tastes, habits, and what they read. If
you find a strong taste for any special
thing, such as music or cricket, you may
work out that subject.</p>

<p class='c008'>But if, as is too often the case, the
youth has not thought seriously about
anything, it is surely best to draw from
your own stores, and tell experiences
which will be new and interesting from
their curiosity, such as the ways and habits
of the lower animals which you may have
observed, the manners of men, or of strange
cities which you have visited, the feats
you have seen performed. These things
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>are seldom suitable for other kinds of
society, when any display of your own
experiences is offensive; but in talking
to young, fresh, and ingenuous people,
the novelty of the information you give
them will generally obscure their critical
or fault-finding sense, and even if they
are very sceptical as to facts,—the young
and inexperienced in our day are usually
so,—they will fully appreciate the effort
to make them feel happy.</p>

<p class='c008'><a id='s47'></a>§ 47. It is perhaps not till then that
you will succeed in probing out some
interesting nook in their short experience.
They have been in accidental contact with
some great or notorious person, and have
seen him in his leisure moments; they may
have lived in a peculiar country, where
either the sport or the natural features are
very interesting, and upon which they can
have the distinction of instructing older
and wiser people.</p>

<p class='c008'>I have met quiet country gentlemen,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>who in their youth had seen active
service in the army, and fought in remarkable
campaigns, who never spoke
of these things among their neighbours,
so that when some intelligent stranger
drew from them their experiences, it came
like a revelation to those who for years
had voted them stupid and dull members
of their county society.</p>

<p class='c008'>So important and so neglected is this
duty of probing for the strong point of
others, which is naturally brought forward,
in connection with the effort to talk with
the young and inexperienced, that I am
disposed to lay this down as a practical
rule: <i>if you find the company dull, blame
yourself</i>. With more skill and more
patience on your part it is almost certain
you would have found it agreeable. If
even two or three people in a company
acted on this rule, how seldom would our
social meetings prove a failure!</p>

<p class='c008'><a id='s48'></a>§ 48. We come now to a still more indelible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>contrast than that of age, and ask
what effects, advantageous or otherwise,
has the contrast of sex upon conversation?
It is a problem very difficult indeed to
solve, for while it is a great law of nature
that the very instincts of each sex urge it
to please the other, it is on the contrary a
great law of society that (perhaps for this
very reason) a large number of topics are
not to be discussed by the sexes in common.
It is then a case where nature
stimulates and tradition restrains: which
shall we declare to be stronger? That
depends altogether upon the character of
the society in which we live. If it be
perfectly free—let us say the society of
the Navigator Islands—there the natural
attraction of opposite sexes must make
their conversation far more agreeable
than that of men or women separately.</p>

<p class='c008'>So it is too among those exceptional
sets of people in civilised countries, who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>brave public opinion so far as to speak
their minds to the other sex, and whose
conversation is accordingly considered too
free by the average of people around
them. In this it is natural that the more
restrained sex should take the initiative;
but if any woman makes bold to speak
with perfect freedom among men, and if
she be gifted with the ordinary talents for
conversation, she will be more agreeable
than an intelligent man who says the
same things—or rather she will say
things in a fresher way; the very situation
is somewhat piquant, and so she will
certainly gain by the contrast of sex. A
small party of men and women of this
sort ought to produce the most amusing
conversation possible. But I need only
hint how easily such a society may
transgress the due limits, and degenerate
into what the later Athenians
thought brilliant, and collected in a special
book. Nor will freedom, far less audacity,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>in conversation redeem ignorance, rudeness,
or graver vices.</p>

<p class='c008'>Take another kind of society, either
one of Puritanical strictness—I remember
when the word <i>girl</i> was thought rather
improper in religious Dublin society, you
should say <i>young person</i>—or else that sort
of foreign society which, from suspicion
and fear, prohibits any intimacy between
young men and women, or brands such
intimacy as foreign to good society. There
can be no doubt that here contrast of sex is
fatal to conversation, which must needs be
constrained, conventional, and occupied
with topics either too trivial or too serious
for proper recreation. Women living under
these conditions find no interest in studying
the subjects that interest men—especially
politics; and so it comes to pass that
in the greater part of orderly modern
English society, a company of men only is
thought more agreeable than a mixed one—even
though the ladies be not so strict
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>as in the extreme cases mentioned, but
merely confined to domestic and moral
topics, to the exclusion of public affairs.</p>

<p class='c008'><a id='s49'></a>§ 49. This being the general aspect of
the problem, it only remains to apply the
principles already attained in the case of
a dialogue with one of the other sex. In
old times, that extreme form of courtesy
called gallantry was thought the proper
way to please a woman. It is now
almost vulgar, and the man who desires to
flatter an intelligent woman most keenly,
and interest her, will take care to treat
her as an intellectual equal, not as a plaything
or a pet. A man who seizes the
opportunity of a conversation to consult
a lady on some social difficulty, or makes
her for the moment his confidante in some
matter not to be divulged, will be almost
sure to find her agreeable and sympathetic.</p>

<p class='c008'>Men, especially elderly men, are far
more easily flattered by women, and more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>easily carried away by such flattery.
For this reason I think it unnecessary,
nay, perhaps mischievous, to give
any advices to ladies how to use this
powerful engine in society. The real
difficulty under which they labour as to
conversation is to hit off the right mean
between prudery and its opposite, to know
how far to speak out frankly, and when
to put a bridle on the talker who threatens
to overstep the bounds of the reverence
due to ourselves and to one another.</p>

<p class='c008'>This reverence is, of course, due most
especially to youth, and elderly people
who discuss before young boys and girls
any topics not perfectly pure, are guilty
of such a crime in conversation as can
hardly be punished too severely. Before
other elderly people the case is somewhat
different, and things may then be said
or implied which should not be selected
for discussion in the presence of the
young. But above all, let us be strict
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>in checking this kind of licence, which is
so apt to take possession of the baser
minds among us, and degrade conversation—the
recreation of intellect and the
mirror of social goodness—into a serious
mischief.</p>

<p class='c008'><a id='s50'></a>§ 50. What I have said above concerning
the duty of treating the other
sex as strict equals in conversation, is
but another instance of the principle already
laid down (<a href='#s40'>§ 40</a>), that no really
bright social intercourse is possible without
equality. There is, in fact, nothing so
democratic as good conversation, nothing
so Protestant, for we must seem to assert
our private judgment, even where we
assent. And as a man does best to seek
a woman’s opinion, and ask her advice,
so as to make her feel on the same
plane, a woman who desires to be agreeable
should differ without hesitation from
the opinions expressed by men, and
assert her independence of judgment, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>her consequent right to take part in a
real conversation. A woman who does
this, even stupidly, and without good
reasons, is better than those who sit down
and acquiesce in whatever is said by men;
this latter is the acknowledgment of inferiority
which is subversive of all pleasant
talk.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'><span class='sc'>Degrees of Intimacy</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c022'><a id='s51'></a>§ 51. The only other classification of
the members of a small society worth
making here is in accordance with the
various degrees of their previous intimacy.
They may either be a family party consisting
of near relations, or a friendly
party consisting of intimate friends, or a
party of casual acquaintances who meet
not unfrequently, or a chance collection
of almost strangers. In all these cases
there is naturally some modification to
be made in the rules and conditions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>of agreeable talking. And first of all
let us warn those who think it is not
worth while taking trouble to talk in their
family circle, or who read the newspaper
at meals, that they are making a mistake
which has far-reaching consequences. It
is nearly as bad as those convent schools
or ladies’ academies, when either silence
or a foreign tongue is imposed at meals,
and concerning which I have already
spoken. Whatever people may think of
the value of theory, there is no doubt
whatever that practice is necessary for
conversation, and it is at home, among
those who are intimate, and free in expressing
their thoughts, that this practice must
be sought. It is thus, and thus only, that
young people can go out into the world
properly provided with the only universal
introduction to society—agreeable manners.</p>

<p class='c008'>Here, then, conversation is not so much
a recreation as a duty, and so becomes
too grave a matter for this book. I will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>merely say a word upon the position of
a guest who is introduced into such a
party, to whose daily trifles, family feuds,
or friendships, he is a stranger. It is
of course the first duty of the family
not to monopolise the topics by discussing
family histories unknown and uninteresting
beyond their circle. Menander
long ago complained of the misfortune of
falling into a party of this kind.<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c021'><sup>[11]</sup></a> On the
other hand, the stranger must assume a
temporary interest in affairs outside his
ordinary life, and merely for the sake of
his hosts. But if he is appealed to as an
umpire by members who habitually differ
in opinion (and this he will easily note),
let him be very wary of giving a decision,
and rather discover that there is truth on
each side of the question.</p>

<div class='fn'>

<p class='c012'><span class='label'><a href='#r11'>11</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Cf. my <i>Social Life of Greece</i>, p. 317.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c008'><a id='s52'></a>§ 52. Far easier is the position of a
party of intimate friends. They have
probably become friends simply because
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>they enjoy each other’s society, and have
many topics of interest in common. It
requires no exertion to make them talk,
and they will readily condone moments of
taciturnity and depression in one or more
members of the party. They want no
advice, and need no instruction, for this is
the only true and permanent human bond
which makes men and women ever sympathetic,
and ever agreeable to one
another.</p>

<p class='c008'><a id='s53'></a>§ 53. As regards a company of strangers,
on the contrary, all the principles stated in
the earlier parts of this book will have
their clearest application. To interest or
to fascinate a stranger requires all the gifts
there enumerated, and in proportion as we
possess them, and take pains to use them,
we shall succeed in turning the stranger
into the friend. There is no greater test
of conversational powers than to go into
a company of strangers, to make them
feel at home, to turn their minds to some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>common thought, and establish an agreeable
and sociable spirit where there was at
first nothing but coldness and diffidence.
To do this single handed is a feat beyond
the power of most people. But if
several persons make an effort in the
same direction, the combination will effect
what a single genius can hardly accomplish.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nothing proves more conclusively the
value of practice in these things than the
fact that the higher classes, who are
compelled through constant moving about
both at home and abroad to converse frequently
with casual acquaintances, and who
in various society often meet strangers—these
are the people in whom we generally
observe ease in conversation under
such conditions. We set it down to
good breeding, but this means that not
only they but their ancestors have been
practising it. Hereditary virtues have
not been created with less labour than
any other virtues. Generally they require
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>the efforts of several generations, and are
therefore the most arduous and meritorious
of all.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'><span class='sc'>The Topics of Conversation—Serious and Trivial</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c022'><a id='s54'></a>§ 54. Having now exhausted the subjective
side, that is to say the qualities in
the speaker and the conditions among the
hearers which make or mar conversation,
it is natural to proceed to the objective
side and see how far we can classify the
topics which form the matter of our talk.
Of course a division of the actual subjects
under specific heads would require an
encyclopædia, and even then would never
be complete, for the very essence of good
conversation is to wander through all possible
things in heaven, in earth, and under
the earth without bond or limit, the only
universal condition being that we should
range far and near and seek all possible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>variety, or rather let ourselves drift from
point to point, and not determine to hold
a fixed course. The quantity, therefore, of
subjects being infinite, and so not to be
described, we must content ourselves with
regarding them in quality as either serious
or trivial; in relation to the speakers, as
either universal or personal; in the mode of
treatment, as handled either in council, in
controversy, or in exposition.</p>

<p class='c008'><a id='s55'></a>§ 55. Our theory has declared itself
long ago against over-seriousness in conversation.
This caution is specially necessary
nowadays,—when people read so
many books and work so hard,—lest they
should regard conversation as a deliberate
method of instruction and channel of improvement.
Nay, these very objects will
be far better attained indirectly and by the
way, while the company is indulging in
talk as a recreation.</p>

<p class='c008'>But it is almost needless to say that the
most solid and lasting recreation, the most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>excellent refreshment of the soul, is to be
had from very serious converse, especially
where not more than two or three are
gathered together, and to exclude this precious
comfort from any theory of conversation
would be absurd. On the other
hand, when two people are earnestly
engaged on a really serious topic, we may
leave them to themselves, and need not
intrude upon them any idle considerations
as to their manner of treating it. For this
is not conversation in the proper sense.
‘In this frame of mind,’ says Hawthorne
in his <i>Transformation</i> (chap. ii.), ‘men
sometimes find their profoundest truths
side by side with the idlest jest, and utter
one or the other, apparently without distinguishing
which is the more valuable or
assigning any considerable value to either.’
He hits the truth exactly. Great seriousness
is as detrimental to a general talk as
excessive trifling. For as the latter fails
after a few moments to interest people who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>have any sense, so the former fails to
recreate or amuse, and is in fact earnest
work invading the proper domain of
leisure.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is therefore no general direction
here possible save to avoid both
extremes, or rather to avoid persistence
in either extreme, for it is better to
have them in turn, than to cultivate
subjects which are indifferent. Brilliant
talk should alternate between grave
and gay, and above all shun dryness,
detail, minuteness—in a word, tediousness.</p>

<p class='c008'>The moment at which by common consent
people talk trivialities is the moment
of first introduction. And here the weather
is almost invariably the first pawn to be
moved. It is amazing what triteness and
endless repetition is tolerated by society on
this point. The facts stated are common
property, and agreed to by all, so that the
first object of ordinary people seems to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>to express nothing while they are saying
something. Yet I suppose what is sanctioned
by almost universal practice must
have some good reason behind it, and
is perhaps meant to give people time
to observe each other without apparent
rudeness. This method of opening the
game seems, however, so stale that every
sensible person should have some paradox
or heresy about the weather ready
whereby he may break through this
idle skirmishing and make the people
about him begin to think as soon as
possible. On the other hand it is easy
to overdo this attempt, and begin with
something so serious that the unprepared
audience is frightened and chilled.
Thus there can be no greater blunder
than to inquire suddenly about the
state of a man’s soul, a sort of <i>coup</i>
which many pious people have actually
thought a decent introduction to a conversation.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>
  <h2 class='c006'><span class='sc'>The Topics of Conversation—General and Personal</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c022'><a id='s56'></a>§ 56. Here we have before us one of
the most difficult of problems, and which
I shall rather state than attempt to solve.
Should we aim at making our conversation
universal in subject, or should we prefer it
to be on personal topics, such as gossip
or scandal—the character of some mutual
friend, an enemy, and so forth? There is
not the smallest doubt that if we wish it
to be profitable and improving, personal
topics should be avoided, and that we
should talk not about people but about
things. And when an assembly of really
cultivated people discusses literary questions,
such as the comparative merits of
poets or novelists, there is not only great
pleasure to be gained from such a society,
but the after-taste is good, and you feel
that your leisure has not been in vain.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>On the other hand it is idle to deny
that in most companies people have not
read or thought enough to join in such a
conversation or to enjoy it, whereas details
of personal life, the latest anecdote, the
facts or surmises about some scandal, the
adverse criticism of some acquaintance—all
this kind of thing, ranging from
harmless gossip into libellous scandal, is
deeply interesting to almost everybody,
and though by no means improving is
always entertaining.</p>

<p class='c008'>But even so let the scandalmonger beware.
If his ordinary topics are the
characters of his acquaintances, he will
soon find himself shunned or treated with
suspicion by society; and nothing so completely
kills all the pleasure of a company
as a protest from any one present that he
will not have his absent friend maligned,
and that he denies the truth of what has
just been said. To apologise to him for
the statement or to resist him with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>argument is equally fatal, for the whole
ease and good temper required for pleasant
talk has vanished for that occasion.</p>

<p class='c008'><a id='s57'></a>§ 57. For this reason, unless the talk
consists of confidences between two people
who thoroughly understand one another,
in which case I hold personal topics to be
far the easiest and the most agreeable, it
should be our duty to raise if possible the
gossip about individuals into reflections
upon classes or even principles. Thus if
a young lady tells you that such a man
is conceited, you may raise the question
how far conceit is excusable, or whether
it may not be commendable, whether it
means a false estimate of poor endowments
or a just estimate of considerable
attainments, and so forth. Or else you
may inquire whether men or women are
the more conceited as a rule, and whether
Aristotle was not right in setting down
over-bashfulness as a vice. Beginning
then with the characters of individuals,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>which is the easiest prologue, and in
which somebody will always be ready to
start, disengage the general or common
feature, and you will not only avoid
personalities, but enable those who have
no knowledge and interest about the
person described to join in the broader
discussion of social ethics. And let it not
be imagined that because these things
have been discussed millions of times they
are therefore trite and dull. Just as each
succeeding philosopher insists on thinking
out again for himself what seems to
have been thoroughly exhausted by his
predecessors, so every member of society
thinks himself capable of deciding over
again upon questions which have been
settled by thousands of other people to
their own satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c008'>I said just now that when two people
only are conversing, personal topics are
most suitable, and of all these the confessions
of either to the other are the best.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>In the first place nothing is so agreeable to
most men as to have their own history the
object of sympathy, and that is the meaning
of the trite adage: Talk to people
about themselves, and not about yourself.
And again, nothing can be more fascinating
than genuine autobiography—I mean
confessions of human experience not set
down for the public, not trussed and
cooked for their use, but the real out-speaking
of a human heart. This it is
which makes autobiographies so popular
as books, though as soon as any one begins
to confess to the public, all the real
depth and intimacy of his experience
vanishes, generally to make way for
exhibitions of morbid vanity. It is
only one man in a million who has the
modesty and the shamelessness, the
innocence and the impudence to unveil
all his real life to the world of strangers.<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c021'><sup>[12]</sup></a></p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f12'>
<p class='c012'><span class='label'><a href='#r12'>12</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I may cite the autobiographies of Benvenuto Cellini
and of Alfieri in their complete Italian form as the most
real, if not the only real, specimens I know.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>
  <h2 class='c006'><span class='sc'>Topics of Conversation—Modes of Treatment</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c022'><a id='s58'></a>§ 58. Finally, we may distinguish the
mode in which all subjects may be treated,
just as the old rhetoricians divided the
various modes of oratory; for, as we said
at the outset, conversation may be in
theory regarded as informal rhetoric. The
old division, then, of orations was based on
the form which the company of hearers
and speakers assumed. Was it a deliberative
assembly, which sat in conclave, as it
were, to find out the truth or the right thing
to do upon an open question? Then the
proper form of eloquence was the <i>Deliberative</i>,
that of the Senate-house or Parliament
suggesting arguments with gravity
and modesty,<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c021'><sup>[13]</sup></a> receiving with deference and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>attention the views of others, stimulating
all to give their opinions. Was it a
judicial court, where the question was a
dispute, and the speakers had their line determined
as plaintiffs or defendants? Then
the form was the <i>Controversial</i>, in which
each side was bound to make the best of
its own case, and the worst of the adversary’s;
in which each speaker was to bid
for the favour of the court, and only limit
the violence of his invective by the fear
of alienating the judges of the case, and
so defeating the object he had in view.
Lastly, was the meeting one which merely
came together to be impressed or amused
by the display of a single speaker, to whom
the topic was prescribed, and whose duty
it was to excite the emotions and enlist
the sympathy of his hearers? Then the
proper form was the <i>Florid</i>, or <i>Epideictic</i>,
as they called it, where display was the
object, where pomp and ornament were in
their proper place.</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f13'>
<p class='c012'><span class='label'><a href='#r13'>13</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I need hardly say that the present Houses of Parliament
in England and elsewhere, if we except the
House of Lords, will not serve as specimens.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span><a id='s59'></a>§ 59. These distinctions are with reasonable
reservations clearly applicable to conversation.
The best kind is when the
subject is discussed by the company as if
at an informal council, in which each
member gives his opinion, and contributes
something to the common stock; where
each is not only listened to in turn, but
is expected to speak, and where the variety
of views and of the expression of them
constitutes the very charm of the company.
The more people succeed in adopting this
form of discussion, the more successful
their society will be. The most perfect
host and hostess are those who induce all
their guests to talk, and elicit even from
the silent and the bashful some stray
flash of intelligence, which gives additional
flavour to the spiritual repast.</p>

<p class='c008'>It may happen, however, that the topic
is taken up by two leading minds in the
company, and discussed as a controversy,
each putting forth his strength to wrestle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>with his friendly adversary. Then it may
be desirable for the rest to take sides in
sympathy, and encourage the conflict of
wit or argument. This sort of society may
be exceedingly pleasant, provided the disputants
keep their temper, and provided
they do not monopolise too great a share
of the time and attention of the rest.
There is hardly a company which will
not tire of the discussion of a single
subject, however important or interesting.
Nevertheless the controversial form is
distinctly an agreeable and often highly
instructive form of conversation, and many
a society of ordinary people attain to the
enjoyment of an excellent evening by
encouraging two leading spirits to show
their powers.</p>

<p class='c008'>The same good result may be obtained
when the company comes together for the
purpose of hearing some remarkable person,
who is held out as the attraction of the
party. It is not conversation, in any real
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>sense, unless it stimulates others to speak;
but still we must include in our survey
those cases where the funny man, or the
Arctic traveller, or the superannuated
detective, or the escaped nihilist, undertakes
to tell his experiences, and delight
us with ‘real fiction.’ This is truly the
epideictic or <i>show-off</i> style, in which the
solitary speaker is supposed to delight
and display himself without a rival, or
with a rival silenced before him. Indeed,
it is matter of common remark that two or
three such talkers are apt to neutralise
one another and produce no effect. Each
is supposed to be afraid of the other, or
jealous of the other, and so wanting in
that spontaneity or <i>abandon</i> only attained
in a congenial atmosphere. This is not
my experience of Irish wits, of whom a
wise English friend often remarked to
me: There is no use in asking one Irishman
to dinner; you must ask another to
draw him out.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>
  <h2 class='c006'><span class='sc'>Epilogue</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c022'><a id='s60'></a>§ 60. The theory of conversation here
attempted seems to be completely contained
in the foregoing paragraphs, so far
as the author has been able to investigate
it. No doubt many of his readers will
wonder that a subject so interesting can
be made so dry, and will complain (in spite
of <a href='#s5'>§ 5</a>) that he has not given at least a few
specimens of what he approves. If he is
unable to compose them, why not cull
them from the best novel literature of the
day? It is, of course, quite easy to give
such examples, which can be found in
thousands from the comedies of Sheridan
to the stories of Lever—who was himself,
like Sheridan, a great master of conversation.
But who ever profited directly
in his own conversation by reading conversations?
Who could ever transfer to
ordinary intercourse the imaginary dialogues
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>of romance? They may be elaborate
and studied, like those of Walter
Scott’s heroines, and indeed the lovers’
dialogues of almost all novelists; or they
may be perfectly natural and easy, like
those of Charles Lever just referred to.
But in either case they are stereotyped in
their book, and are useless even as models.
One may quote from them an occasional
brilliant or foolish remark, as one may
from any book, but that is all.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is always this difficulty about
any practice, which has never been reduced
to rule, that the laws of it, when
set forth in order, seem trivial and
dull; nor will the student believe that
such valuable and complicated results can
be derived from mere truisms. We are
quite accustomed to that surprise in the
case of logic. The whole system of
human reasoning in all its wonderful intricacy
is built up from a few general
principles in themselves perfectly and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>necessarily obvious, just as the prose of
Ruskin and the poetry of Browning are
expressed in combinations of twenty-six
letters. But as in this case the theory
of composing words is easy enough, and
yet the art a mystery, which only very
few can ever attain in perfection,—each,
too, after his own fashion, and stamped
with his own genius,—so the theory of
conversation may be reduced to a small
number of general observations, and yet
the perfect practice of it is a mystery,
which defies analysis—one of the myriad
manifestations of human genius which all
can admire but no one can ever explain.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
